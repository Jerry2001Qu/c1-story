"Folks, I make no apologies for being the most pro-union president, American history (applause). No, I mean it. You know, you've heard me say it before, but I'll say it again and again and again... The middle class built this country, not Wall Street. And guess what? Unions built the middle class. And I know how to say union. It's amazing how a lot of people talk about labor... Unions. Unions. "

5. (SOUNDBITE) (English) U.S. PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN SAYING:
"One of the things we're going to change in the second term is we're going to have a fairer tax system. We got it a little fairer. We made those 55 companies that didn't pay a penny in taxes and made 40 billion dollars.
We made them pay, but it's only 22% or 15% so they're not paying enough. You got out there literally you got a thousand billionaires in America, up to a thousand billionaires. You know what their average tax rate is?... 8.3%. (boos from audience) Well now what? Here's the point I want to make, no this is very serious. I'm not joking about this one. The fact of the matter is Trump wants to give him another, and he's said it, a $5 trillion tax cut over the next five years. No, I'm not joking. You know, we're going to do we're going to stop and we're going to spend that money on child care. We're going to spend that money, No, I mean it, we're going to spend that money on elder care."

13. (SOUNDBITE)(English) SENIOR FELLOW AT THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS AND PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, CHARLES KUPCHAN, SAYING:
“It is important for the American electorate to know whether Biden is in good shape, and what we saw at the debate was an aberration, a one-off, or whether there is a more systematic decline. And that kind of more systematic decline would probably be apparent over a course of a seven-day summit of this sort. Will foreign leaders be making their own assessments about this? I'm sure they have to, simply because it's too much a part of the political conversation and part of their own effort to judge where things stand. Are they going to say anything about this, or will they be public about it? Absolutely not. This is going to be a summit that focuses on the diplomacy, on support for Ukraine. No leader is going to run the risk of intervening in American politics by offering some sort of public judgment about President Biden's cognitive capabilities.”

“I think the summit agenda, the conversations, will be unaffected by the continuing discussions about President Biden's debate performance and whether he should stay in the race. NATO summits are fairly scripted affairs. The deliverables are worked out well in advance. And in many respects, this is a diplomatic meeting that will focus on supporting Ukraine, and behind the scenes there's a great deal of anxiety about the US election and who's going to come out on top. There's a great deal of anxiety about similar political developments in Europe.”

19. (SOUNDBITE)(English) SENIOR FELLOW AT THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS AND PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, CHARLES KUPCHAN, SAYING:
“I think one of the strong suits of President Biden when it comes to a contest with Donald Trump is his popularity on the global stage, the degree to which he's rebuilt alliances, the successful effort to prevent Russia from subjugating Ukraine. And the president had a series of events at D-Day, a big meeting in Paris, a meeting at the G7 in which he showcased his leadership of NATO and of the West. And that will, that will be on show during the NATO summit. And then is an opportunity for the President to try to alleviate some of the doubts that emerged from his debate performance.”

"One of the presidents of a big country, he stood up, said, 'Well, sir, if we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us?' I said, 'You didn't pay? You're delinquent?' He said, 'Yes, let's say that happened.' (AND TRUMP SAYS HE RESPONDED:) 'No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.' "

24. (SOUNDBITE)(English) SENIOR FELLOW AT THE COUNCIL ON FOREIGN RELATIONS AND PROFESSOR OF INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, CHARLES KUPCHAN, SAYING:
“I think that it right across the alliance, right across NATO members, including Ukraine, there is hope, if not prayer, for a second Biden term because Biden did reinvigorate the Atlantic alliance. Biden has led the effort to support Ukraine. And in contrast, Trump turned his back on the allies during his first term in office. He mused about withdrawing from NATO. He has said during this election campaign, if there are NATO members who don't spend enough on defense, I'm going to tell the Russians to have their way with them. And there is concern that the United States could withdraw from NATO if President Trump is returned to office.”

“Ukraine will dominate the conversation, as it should. There is a major war going on. The Ukrainians suffered through a delay in the arrival of American aid, about seven months while Congress debated what turned out to be a $61 billion package. The armaments that are bought with that money have been arriving. They are getting to the front and that is enabling Ukraine to hold the line.”

“Well, I do think that there will be a conversation about NATO's ability to protect NATO members. Right? We've got two new members of NATO, Sweden and Finland. Finland has a very long land border with Russia that requires NATO to update its operational plans for the defense of NATO territory, including Finland and Estonia and other countries that either border Russia, border Belarus, which is an ally of Russia. So, there's, there are - there are just nitty gritty things that will get discussed at this summit. China will surely be on the agenda because there is concern about Chinese support for Russia during its war against Ukraine. There is concern about what steps NATO's collectively needs to take economically as well as strategically to deal with the China threat.”
