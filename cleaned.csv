2. VARIOUS OF CROWD WATCHING FIREWORKS

3. VARIOUS OF FIREWORKS OVER VICTORIA HARBOUR

4. (SOUNDBITE) (English) 18-YEAR-OLD HONG KONG RESIDENT, HUMARIA, SAYING:

“I didn’t see the fireworks during New Year's, or Christmas last year, this is the first time in a long time I watched the fireworks and I think the last time I watched it I was really young, maybe less than 10 years old, so seeing it again for the first time in a long time was very eye-opening for me. I thought the colours, and the display, and even the sounds were really enjoyable and nice.”

5. BOY WATCHING FIREWORKS

6. VARIOUS OF CROWD FILMING FIREWORKS

7. (SOUNDBITE) (Cantonese) 45-YEAR-OLD MAINLAND TOURIST, LIU, SAYING:

“This spring festival I wanted to bring my parents to somewhere I think is most beautiful and festive to celebrate, so we came to Hong Kong. Hong Kong has a beautiful view and clean air and most importantly people from Hong Kong are extremely friendly. That's why we think Hong Kong is a suitable place for us to come celebrate the festival.”

“I hope in Dragon New Year, my life (will) become better in everything, and then I have more love for my family and then all will be better. And I am stronger about the struggle in my life.”

12. VARIOUS OF PEOPLE WATCHING AND FILMING FIREWORKS

STORY: Fireworks lit up Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour on Sunday (February 11) as the city celebrated the second day of the Lunar New Year.

This year's festivities mark Hong Kong's first Lunar New Year celebration since pandemic restrictions were lifted.

In addition to the 23-minute firework spectacle, the city is welcoming the Year of the Dragon with multiple other events, including a parade float, and a horse racing with live music and lion dancing, according to Hong Kong tourism board.

The festivities are part of Hong Kong's push to attract international tourists.

Hong Kong's leader John Lee unveiled a promotion campaign last February to lure visitors, businesses and investors back to the financial hub after more than three years of tough COVID-19 curbs.

STORY: The Paris 2024 Olympics' venue for badminton and rhythmic gymnastics was inaugurated by Mayor Anne Hidalgo on Sunday (February 11).

The Adidas Arena, with an 8,000-seat capacity, is the only new venue built within Paris' walls for the Summer Games. It will also host para-badminton and para-weight lifting.

Construction began in 2021, and its opening was within schedule, Hidalgo said. The arena's keys will be handed to the International Olympic Committee in May 2024.

In a nod to sustainability, the arena uses photovoltaic panels for electricity, collects rain water for toilet use, and boasts 6,300 square meters of greenery on its rooftops. The seats were produced with recycled plastic bottle caps. And soon there will be a heating facility that will capture cold and hot air, and provide heat for the Arena and neighbouring residential buildings.

The Adidas Arena will also be the home court of Paris Basketball, a local club who will be the first occupants of the premises before the Olympics. It will also be a venue for music and corporate events.

The arena also aims to refresh the north eastern Paris district of Porte de la Chappelle, which has a reputation for drug use and homelessness.

The Adidas Arena, with an 8,000-seat capacity, is the only new venue built within Paris' walls for the Summer Games. It will also host para-badminton and para-weight lifting.

Construction began in 2021, and its opening was within schedule, Hidalgo said. The arena's keys will be handed to the International Olympic Committee in May 2024.

In a nod to sustainability, the arena uses photovoltaic panels for electricity, collects rain water for toilet use, and boasts 6,300 square meters of greenery on its rooftops. The seats were produced with recycled plastic bottle caps. And soon there will be a heating facility that will capture cold and hot air, and provide heat for the Arena and neighbouring residential buildings.

The Adidas Arena will also be the home court of Paris Basketball, a local club who will be the first occupants of the premises before the Olympics. It will also be a venue for music and corporate events.

The arena also aims to refresh the north eastern Paris district of Porte de la Chappelle, which has a reputation for drug use and homelessness."

“We are here to support the health system that suffering not only because of the chronic blockade and these actual war, but also from the movement of population that impedes health workers to do their work at the best possible way. A ceasefire has to be achieved as soon as possible now, so that we make sure that the health workers are able to deliver at the best of their capacities.”

“We just visited the trauma ward which was completely overcrowded. Overcrowded with trauma cases, but also with 50 medical cases which were, which were there already for days and which should be kept at other wards but there was no place. We brought in medical supplies, trauma supplies and anaesthetics, etc. There's a chronic shortage of analgesics, of medicine, dialysis medicines, lab equipment, but also specifically orthopaedic and orthopaedic supplies and trauma supplies. We will continue to, of course, as WHO to supply that.”

9. EXTERIOR OF AL AQSA HOSPITAL

STORY: The World Health Organisation (WHO) delivered trauma supplies, medicines, and vaccines to Al Aqsa hospital in central Gaza on Saturday (February 10), for the first time in nearly a month.

The 270-bed hospital currently accommodates 400 patients and over 5,000 people seeking shelter, with one-third of hospitalised patients being unable to be discharged due to the lack of safe place to go, WHO said.

Al Aqsa hospital has gradually restored functionality, expanding from just five doctors in January to approximately 300 physicians and 400 nurses, yet WHO noted the hospital still experiences immense needs in supplies and facilitation for patient referrals outside of the Gaza Strip.

Health authorities in Gaza, which is controlled by Hamas, estimate about 28,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed in the region since the conflict began in October.

STORY: Hundreds of supporters of former Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan’s party protested in Karachi on Sunday (February 11) against election results.

“Our mandate has been stolen. We were winning with a two-third majority. PTI was winning across Pakistan with a two-third majority but they stole our mandate,"" said Muneeza Kamran, a polling agent for a PTI candidate.

PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) party supporters, who gathered outside the Sindh Election Commission office, also condemned the delay in publishing the final tally of votes, which happened more than 60 hours after voting ended.

Pakistan's interim government said the voting count delay was caused by communications issues due to a mobile internet outage on election day. The outage, which authorities said was for security reasons, drew concern from human rights groups and foreign governments.

The final results of Pakistan's national election put independents, backed by jailed Khan, in the lead with 93 of 264 seats.

The party of another former prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, was second with 75 seats after Thursday's (February 8) vote, lacking a clear majority but it was the largest single party in parliament as Khan's independents ran as individuals.

TIMELINE: Iran and its role in the Israel-Hamas conflict
VIDEO SHOWS: TIMELINE OF EVENTS RELATED TO IRAN AND ITS ROLE IN THE ISRAEL-HAMAS CONFLICT

SHOWS: OCTOBER 10, 2023

Iran's top authority Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on October 10 Tehran had not been involved in the Hamas group's weekend attack on Israel, but he hailed what he called Israel's ""irreparable"" military and intelligence defeat.

TEHRAN, IRAN (FILE - OCTOBER 10, 2023) (POOL VIA WANA - No use Iran, no use BBC Persian, no use VOA Persian, no use Manoto, No use Iran International)

1. SUPREME LEADER OF IRAN AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI ADDRESSING STUDENTS AT MILITARY ACADEMY GRADUATION CEREMONY

2. (SOUNDBITE) (Farsi) SUPREME LEADER OF IRAN, AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI, SAYING (PARTLY OVERLAID WITH TOP SHOT OF GRADUATION):

""Supporters of the regime (of Israel) and some people within the usurper's regime itself, have made false statements in the past few days and continue to do so, including that Iran is coming behind this movement. They are wrong. Of course, we defend Palestine, we defend the struggle, we kiss the hands of those intelligent and brave Palestinian youths who planned the attack on the zionist regime.

But I warn, if the genocide in Gaza continues, they will not be spared from this fire. It is our home and West Asia is our region. We do not compromise with any party and any side, and we have no reservation when it comes to our home's security. The genocide in Gaza must stop immediately. The forced displacement of the people of Gaza must be stopped immediately. Today, Gaza is waiting for urgent and vital humanitarian aid. According to international law, the Palestinian Liberation Movement, Hamas, is fighting the occupation and has a legitimate right. Mr. President, according to our negotiations, Hamas is ready to release civilian prisoners. On the other hand, the world should support the release of 6,000 Palestinians held in Israeli prisons.""

1. VARIOUS OF FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP WALKING ONTO STAGE AT COASTAL CAROLINA UNIVERSITY AS CROWD CHEERS

2. WHITE FLASH

3. (SOUNDBITE) (English) FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP SAYING:

""As you probably know, two days ago, the Biden ‘Department of Injustice’ let ‘Crooked Joe’ off the hook for some of his very egregious crimes, including his brazen theft of classified documents long before he was ever president. He's been doing this for 50 years. I couldn't believe it. I remember a certain senator got up and said, 'No way he did that, no way.' But he did it. He took them when he was a senator. You can't do it. Now in my case, I'm covered by the Presidential Records Act. I'm allowed to do what I do. But he wasn't covered. He was a vice president, not covered, and he was a senator. But this is yet more proof that we have a weaponized two-tier system of justice in this country. Crooked Joe got off scot-free -- I don't know if you call it scot-free -- they said he was a mental basket case, okay, so I wouldn't say it's totally scot-free. In fact, I think maybe if I had my choice, I'd take the other. I would go through a little process, but that's better than what happened. But they said he was a disaster mentally, and he willfully stole gigantic numbers of classified documents, willfully, but because of his condition mentally... Is this guy going to make it to the starting gate, seriously? (CROWD YELLS: 'No!') Well, it shows you the power of incumbency, if that if that happens, it's sort of an incredible thing. But I've been saying no, but you never know.""

4. WHITE FLASH

5. (SOUNDBITE) (English) FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP SAYING:

""The Special Counsel's (referring to Robert Hur) report tries to let Biden off by claiming that he's too mentally incompetent to convict at a trial. But if Joe Biden is not fit to charge, they're not going to charge him with a crime, but it's okay for him to become commander in chief? Think of that one. Think of that one.”

She brought her husband. Where's her husband? Oh, he's away. He's away. What happened to her husband? What happened to her husband? Where is he? He's gone. He knew. He knew.""

8. WHITE FLASH

9. (SOUNDBITE) (English) FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP SAYING:

""I just put it out. They want to give, like, almost $100 billion to a few countries. 100 billion. And I said, and I'm telling you this, this is breaking news. We have breaking news. I said, why do we do this? If you do, you give them not $100 billion; you give it to them as a loan. It's called a loan. Give them the money and if they can pay it back, they pay it back. If they can't pay it back, they don't have to pay it back because, you know, they're they've got some problems. But if they go to another nation, they drop us like a dog, like a female drops a male after a date because he doesn't like her, right? If that happens to our country, then very simply, we call the loan and we say we want our money, because we give money and then they go to another side. As an example, let's say we give all this money, we are already into Ukraine for over $200 billion, and they could make a deal with Russia in the next three weeks, and all of a sudden they don't want to deal with us anymore and we've given hundreds of billions of dollars. And why are we at over $200 billion and the European nations are -- if you add them up, it's a very similar sized economy -- they're at $25 billion. So, we're at 200-plus and it affects them much more. We have a thing called an ocean between us, right? It affects them much more. But we're at 200. They're at 250. I did the same thing with NATO. I got them to pay up. NATO was busted until I came along. I said, 'Everybody's going to pay.' They said, 'Well, if we don't pay, are you still going to protect us?' I said, 'Absolutely not.' They couldn't believe the answer. And everybody, you never saw more money pour in. The Secretary General Stoltenberg - well, I don't know if he is anymore, but he was my biggest fan - he said, 'All these presidents came in. They would make a speech and leave and that was it. And they all owed money, and they wouldn't pay it.' I came in, I made a speech and I said, 'You got to pay up.' They asked me that question. One of the presidents of a big country, he stood up, said, 'Well, sir, if we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us?' I said, 'You didn't pay? You're delinquent?' He said, 'Yes, let's say that happened.' (AND TRUMP SAYS HE RESPONDED:) 'No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.' And the money came flowing in. And Henry would know this if I said, 'Yes, I will. You don't have to pay. Yes, I will.' Most politicians have said to that. 'Yes, we will protect you under any circum...' Well, then they never paying up. I said, 'No, no, you have to understand. You don't pay your bills. You get no protection. It's very simple.' Hundreds of billions of dollars came into NATO. And that's why they have money today, because of what I did. And then I hear that they like Obama better. They should like Obama better. You know why? Because he didn't ask for anything. We were like the stupid country of the world. And we're not going to be the stupid country of the world any longer. We're not going to be. It got bad under, under this guy.""

11. TRUMP ENDING HIS SPEECH SAYING 'And we will make America great again! Thank you very much, South, thank you very much, South Carolina! God bless you all. God bless you. Get out and vote. Get out and vote. Thank you.' / TRUMP DANCING ON STAGE

STORY: The mental ability and age of the United States' presidential candidates took center stage on the campaign trail on Saturday (February 10), as former President Donald Trump accused President Joe Biden of lacking the mental capacity to be president, following a report that suggested Biden was suffering memory lapses.

The issue was thrust front and center again after Special Counsel Robert Hur, a former U.S. attorney in Maryland during Trump's administration, said in his report that he chose not to bring criminal charges against Biden following a 15-month investigation into his handling of classified documents because the president cooperated.

Hur said the Democratic incumbent would be difficult to convict and described him as a ""well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory"" who was not able to recall to investigators when his son, Beau Biden, died.

Trump, at a rally in Conway, South Carolina, said Hur's report showed Biden ""is not fit to serve as our commander in chief.""

Trump - who faces four state and federal criminal trials, including one for mishandling classified documents - is close to clinching the Republican nomination, and the prospect of a likely general election rematch with Biden in November.

Biden angrily denied Hur's allegations about his memory, saying in a White House appearance on Thursday night, ""my memory's fine.""

STORY: Italians in the northern city of Ivrea marked carnival on Sunday (February 11) with the annual 'Battle of the Oranges', a spectacular citrus clash where revellers aim at each other in a time-honoured fruit-throwing skirmish.

Teams dressed in brightly coloured costumes bombarded each other with juicy oranges from Sicily, leaving the town's cobbled streets covered in a thick carpet of mashed orange pulp.

According to one of the legends, poor people during the Middle Ages would throw beans onto the streets to show their resentment toward their feudal lord.

Oranges replaced beans in the Carnival battle in the middle of the 19th century.

According to another legend dating to the 12th century, Violetta, the daughter of a local miller, was bound by feudal laws to spend her wedding night with the town's evil lord.

To save her honour for her betrothed she beheaded the nobleman and set Ivrea free from his tyranny.

The orange-throwing battle, with participants divided between nobles and commoners, recalls Violetta's insurrection against the tyrant, with the oranges symbolising the tyrant's head.

The battle was transformed into a spectacular event after World War Two, by that time representing the fight for liberty and the symbol of the Ivrea Carnival.

10. (SOUNDBITE) (Italian) REVELLER FROM IVREA, VALERIO GIANOTTI, SAYING:

""Come here instead of throwing oranges! It's a way to pressure off and the fact that it attracts a lot of people is a positive thing. It's a good way to pressure off for three days. You can even hurt yourself but you have to be a bit careful.""

11. (SOUNDBITE) (Italian) REVELLER FROM IVREA, CESARE CIANCIOLO, SAYING:

""The atmosphere in the square is amazing. It's something everybody must experience once in a lifetime. When you feel the scent of oranges on a Sunday morning after you have worked for a year...that acrid smell is poetry. It's poetry.""

16. INSTA360 VIDEO OF BATTLE IN SQUARE

STORY: Italians in the northern city of Ivrea marked carnival on Sunday (February 11) with the annual 'Battle of the Oranges', a spectacular citrus clash where revellers aim at each other in a time-honoured fruit-throwing skirmish.

Teams dressed in brightly coloured costumes bombarded each other with juicy oranges from Sicily, leaving the town's cobbled streets covered in a thick carpet of mashed orange pulp.

According to one of the legends, poor people during the Middle Ages would throw beans onto the streets to show their resentment toward their feudal lord.

Oranges replaced beans in the Carnival battle in the middle of the 19th century.

According to another legend dating to the 12th century, Violetta, the daughter of a local miller, was bound by feudal laws to spend her wedding night with the town's evil lord.

To save her honour for her betrothed she beheaded the nobleman and set Ivrea free from his tyranny.

The orange-throwing battle, with participants divided between nobles and commoners, recalls Violetta's insurrection against the tyrant, with the oranges symbolising the tyrant's head.

The battle was transformed into a spectacular event after World War Two, by that time representing the fight for liberty and the symbol of the Ivrea Carnival.","['EUROPEHUMAN INTEREST', 'BRIGHTS', 'ODD NEWSSOCIETY', 'SOCIAL ISSUES']",9236,6,,Broadcast: None.

VIDEO SHOWS: BITE FROM FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP AT CAMPAIGN RALLY

SHOWS: CONWAY, SOUTH CAROLINA, UNITED STATES (FEBRUARY 10, 2024) (U.S. NETWORK POOL - Broadcast: No use USA. Digital: No use USA.)

1. (SOUNDBITE) (English) FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP AT CAMPAIGN RALLY RECALLING A CONVERSATION HE SAID HE HAD WITH 'A PRESIDENT OF A BIG EUROPEAN COUNTRY' SAYING:

(STARTS BY QUOTING THE FOREIGN LEADER:) ""Well, sir, if we don't pay and we're attacked by Russia, will you protect us?' I said, 'You didn't pay? You're delinquent?' He said, 'Yes, let's say that happened.' (AND TRUMP SAYS HE RESPONDED:) 'No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You got to pay. You got to pay your bills.""

STORY: Former U.S. President Donald Trump suggested on Saturday (February 11) that the U.S. might not protect NATO allies who aren't spending enough on defence from a potential Russian invasion.

Trump, speaking during a political rally in South Carolina and appearing to recount a meeting with NATO leaders, quoted the president of ""a big country"" that he did not name as asking, ""Well sir, if we don't pay, and we're attacked by Russia - will you protect us?""

""I said: 'You didn't pay? You're delinquent?' He said: 'Yes, let's say that happened.' No I would not protect you. In fact I would encourage them to do whatever the hell they want. You gotta pay.""

STORY: Top seed Elena Rybakina powered to a 6-1 6-4 win over Russian Daria Kasatkina in the final of the Abu Dhabi Open on Sunday (February 11) to lift her second trophy of the season and seventh overall.

The 2022 Wimbledon champion began the contest on Stadium Court in typically dominant fashion to grab an early break, but seventh seed Kasatkina struck back with one of her own only to fall behind again in blustery conditions.

Rybakina regained composure to go 5-1 up on the back of big serving as Kasatkina struggled for consistency and the 24-year-old Brisbane champion wrapped up the opening set in 25 minutes when her opponent sent a forehand wide.

The pair had come into the contest having split their four meetings - all on hardcourts - and Adelaide runner-up Kasatkina showed plenty of fight to pull two breaks back in the next set with relentless baseline hitting and stunning winners.

Level at 4-4, Rybakina turned the heat up to break the 26-year-old Kasatkina with a crosscourt scorcher and the Moscow-born Kazakh returned after a brief rain delay to secure the victory on serve.

Netanyahu: Working out a 'detailed plan' for Rafah civilians
VIDEO SHOWS: EXCERPTS OF INTERVIEW WITH ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU ON ABC ""THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS'

SHOWS: UNKNOWN AND WASHINGTON, D.C., UNITED STATES (RECENT) (ABC 'This Week with George Stephanopoulos' - No use USA. Must on-screen courtesy: ‘ABC/This Week with George Stephanopoulos'. No Archive.)

1. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JONATHAN KARL, HOST OF ABC ""THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS', SAYING:

""You've directed the Israeli Defense Forces to evacuate Rafah in advance of this ground invasion. Where are those people supposed to go? This is 1.4 million people, many of whom have fled northern Gaza. I mean, they're living in tents. Where are these people supposed to go?""

2. (SOUNDBITE) (English) ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYING:

""Well, Rafah is a very small percentage of Gaza, and I think it's about 10% or 15%.""

KARL: ""I mean, the estimates vary.""

NETANYAHU: (UNCLEAR) Area north of Gaza that has already been cleared.

KARL: ""Well, there's, there's an estimated 1.4 million people in that area right now. And as the German foreign minister said, they can't just disappear. Where are they supposed to go?""

NETANYAHU: ""The areas that we've cleared north of Rafah are --- plenty of areas there, but we are working out a detailed plan to do so, and that's what we've done up to now. We're not, we're not cavalier about this. This is part of our war effort to get civilians out of harm's way. It's part of Hamas's effort to keep them in harm's way. But we've so far succeeded, and we're going to succeed again. Those who say that under no circumstances should we enter Rafah are basically saying, lose the war, keep Hamas there.""

3. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JONATHAN KARL, HOST OF ABC ""THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS', SAYING:

""How many of the 132 hostages do you think are still alive?""

4. (SOUNDBITE) (English) ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYING:

""I think enough to warrant the kind of efforts that we're doing. We're going to try to do our best to get all those who are alive back and frankly, also the bodies of the dead. But I won't go into that right now.""

5. WIDE OF KARL INTERVIEWING NETANYAHU

6. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JONATHAN KARL, HOST OF ABC ""THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS', SAYING:

""Wait a minute. You're saying it's only been one civilian that's been killed for one Hamas terrorist in Gaza?""

7. (SOUNDBITE) (English) ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYING:

""Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Yes. We've killed, we've killed and wounded over 20,000 Hamas terrorists. Out of that, about 12,000 fighters. And we're doing everything we can to minimize civilian casualties and continue to do so. But one thing we're not going to do is we're not going to let Hamas emerge victorious.

8. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JONATHAN KARL, HOST OF ABC ""THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS', SAYING:

""What's your response to President Biden saying the response in Gaza has been ‘over the top’?""

9. (SOUNDBITE) (English) ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYING:

""I appreciate President Biden's support for Israel since the beginning of the war. I don't know exactly what he meant by that, but put yourself in Israel's shoes. We were attacked. Unprovoked attack, murderous attack on October 7th. The worst attack on Jewish people since the Holocaust. And let me tell you, I think we've responded, in a way that goes after the terrorists and tries to minimize the civilian population in which the terrorists embed themselves and use them as human shield.""

10. NETANYAHU SPEAKING

STORY: Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said those warning against an incursion into Rafah ""are basically saying, lose the war.""

Four months into the Israel-Hamas war, Netanyahu's office said it had ordered the military to develop a plan to evacuate Rafah, that sits on Gaza's border with Egypt, and destroy four Hamas battalions it says are deployed there.

Over a million Palestinians crammed into the border city await a full-scale offensive with the rest of the enclave in ruins and nowhere left to run.

Israel's military ordered civilians to flee south before previous assaults on Gaza's cities, but now there is no obvious place to go and aid agencies have said many people could die.

""The areas that we've cleared north of Rafah are --- plenty of areas there, but we are working out a detailed plan to do so, and that's what we've done up to now. We're not, we're not cavalier about this,"" Netanyahu said, in a taped interview that aired on Sunday (February 11)

Netanyahu also said ""enough"" of the 132 remaining Israeli hostages held in Gaza are alive to justify Israel's ongoing war in the region.

Asked how many of the hostages are still alive, Netanyahu said ""enough to warrant the kind of efforts that we're doing.

""You've directed the Israeli Defense Forces to evacuate Rafah in advance of this ground invasion. Where are those people supposed to go? This is 1.4 million people, many of whom have fled northern Gaza. I mean, they're living in tents. Where are these people supposed to go?""

2. (SOUNDBITE) (English) ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYING:

""Well, Rafah is a very small percentage of Gaza, and I think it's about 10% or 15%.""

KARL: ""I mean, the estimates vary.""

NETANYAHU: (UNCLEAR) Area north of Gaza that has already been cleared.

KARL: ""Well, there's, there's an estimated 1.4 million people in that area right now. And as the German foreign minister said, they can't just disappear. Where are they supposed to go?""

NETANYAHU: ""The areas that we've cleared north of Rafah are --- plenty of areas there, but we are working out a detailed plan to do so, and that's what we've done up to now. We're not, we're not cavalier about this. This is part of our war effort to get civilians out of harm's way. It's part of Hamas's effort to keep them in harm's way. But we've so far succeeded, and we're going to succeed again. Those who say that under no circumstances should we enter Rafah are basically saying, lose the war, keep Hamas there.""

3. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JONATHAN KARL, HOST OF ABC ""THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS', SAYING:

""How many of the 132 hostages do you think are still alive?""

4. (SOUNDBITE) (English) ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYING:

""I think enough to warrant the kind of efforts that we're doing. We're going to try to do our best to get all those who are alive back and frankly, also the bodies of the dead. But I won't go into that right now.""

6. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JONATHAN KARL, HOST OF ABC ""THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS', SAYING:

""Wait a minute. You're saying it's only been one civilian that's been killed for one Hamas terrorist in Gaza?""

7. (SOUNDBITE) (English) ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYING:

""Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. Yes. We've killed, we've killed and wounded over 20,000 Hamas terrorists. Out of that, about 12,000 fighters. And we're doing everything we can to minimize civilian casualties and continue to do so. But one thing we're not going to do is we're not going to let Hamas emerge victorious.

8. (SOUNDBITE) (English) JONATHAN KARL, HOST OF ABC ""THIS WEEK WITH GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS', SAYING:

""What's your response to President Biden saying the response in Gaza has been ‘over the top’?""

9. (SOUNDBITE) (English) ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYING:

""I appreciate President Biden's support for Israel since the beginning of the war. I don't know exactly what he meant by that, but put yourself in Israel's shoes. We were attacked. Unprovoked attack, murderous attack on October 7th. The worst attack on Jewish people since the Holocaust. And let me tell you, I think we've responded, in a way that goes after the terrorists and tries to minimize the civilian population in which the terrorists embed themselves and use them as human shield.""

10. NETANYAHU SPEAKING

STORY: Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said those warning against an incursion into Rafah ""are basically saying, lose the war.""

Four months into the Israel-Hamas war, Netanyahu's office said it had ordered the military to develop a plan to evacuate Rafah, that sits on Gaza's border with Egypt, and destroy four Hamas battalions it says are deployed there.

Over a million Palestinians crammed into the border city await a full-scale offensive with the rest of the enclave in ruins and nowhere left to run.

Israel's military ordered civilians to flee south before previous assaults on Gaza's cities, but now there is no obvious place to go and aid agencies have said many people could die.

""The areas that we've cleared north of Rafah are --- plenty of areas there, but we are working out a detailed plan to do so, and that's what we've done up to now. We're not, we're not cavalier about this,"" Netanyahu said, in a taped interview that aired on Sunday (February 11)

TIMELINE: Houthi attacks in the Red Sea and U.S.-led response
VIDEO SHOWS: TIMELINE OF ATTACKS BY HOUTHIS IN YEMEN ON ISRAEL AND SHIPPING IN THE RED SEA AND RESPONSE BY WESTERN COUNTRIES

SENDING WITH COMPLETE SCRIPT

SHOWS: Yemen's Houthi rebels, allies of Hamas in Gaza, were seen storming a cargo ship in the Red Sea, in a video released by the Iran-backed group on Nov. 20, 2023. The footage showed its fighters appear to land by helicopter onto the top deck. The armed men brandished weapons at the ship’s crew, and ordered them to lie down as they seized the ship.

It is important for everyone to know that the Israeli enemy relies on evasion and disguise in its movements in the Red Sea, especially through the Bab Al-Mandab.""

Palestinian militant group Hamas thanked Yemen's Houthis on Nov. 19 for seizing a ship in the southern Red Sea over the conflict in Gaza.

The Houthis, an ally of Tehran, described the ship as Israeli. Israel said the cargo ship seized was British-owned and Japanese-operated, describing the incident as an ""Iranian act of terrorism"" with consequences for international maritime security.

Palestinian militant group Hamas thanked Yemen's Houthis on Nov. 19 for seizing a ship in the southern Red Sea over the conflict in Gaza.

The Houthis, an ally of Tehran, described the ship as Israeli. Israel said the cargo ship seized was British-owned and Japanese-operated, describing the incident as an ""Iranian act of terrorism"" with consequences for international maritime security.

1. (SOUNDBITE) (English) ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYING AFTER BEING ASKED TO RESPOND TO PRESIDENT BIDEN'S COMMENTS THAT 'THE CONDUCT OF THE RESPONSE IN GAZA STRIP HAS BEEN OVER TO TOP':

(BITE BEGINS OVER SPLIT SCREEN WITH FOX NEWS SUNDAY'S SHANNON BREAM) ""No, I've been speaking to him (referring to U.S. President Joe Biden) regularly, but I haven't spoken to him since he made those remarks. I don't know what he meant by that.""

2. WHITE FLASH

3. (SOUNDBITE) (English) ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER BENJAMIN NETANYAHU SAYING:

""The only thing that will get the hostages released is the thing that will defeat Hamas which is a sustained military effort. It already got half the hostages released. It will get the other half too. But I want to say one thing to your audience which people don't realize. Victory is within reach. We have already destroyed three-quarters of the Hamas organized terrorist battalions. Three-quarters. Eighteen out of 24. We're not going to leave the other six. (WHITE FLASH) At the same time, I agree with the U.S. and I've instructed the army accordingly to give us a plan, a dual plan: one, to vacate the population, the civilian population, because we're not fighting them; we're fighting the terrorists. And secondly, to destroy those remaining battalions. Victory is within reach, and we should all strive for that common target to destroy Hamas because that gets all the other objectives within our purview.""

STORY: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday (February 11) he has not spoken to U.S. President Joe Biden since the president made remarks about Israel's military response to Hamas being ""over the top.""

Netanyahu was speaking in an interview on the ""FOX News Sunday"" program.

""I don't know exactly what he meant by that,"" Netanyahu said in reference to the U.S. leader's comments.

12. EMPTY STREET

13. VARIOUS OF TOWN

STORY: Residents of an Israeli town bordering Lebanon voiced despair and anger on Sunday (February 11) as local streets remained eerily quiet after most people were evacuated due to months of Hezbollah rocket fire.

Cross-border fire between Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese armed group has became a daily routine in the north since October 7, when Hamas - a Hezbollah ally - launched attacks into southern Israel from the Gaza strip.

Israel responded with a massive bombardment and ground offensive into Gaza, which killed about 28,000 Palestinians, according to medical authorities in the Hamas-run territory.

The conflict has threatened to spread across the Middle East, with flare-ups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen, as well as a regular exchange of fire between Israel and Hezbollah.

In southern Lebanon, an Israeli strike targeted a Palestinian figure close to Hamas, security sources said on Saturday (February 10).

The target survived but three others were killed, including a member of Hezbollah.

STORY: The San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs made final preparations for Saturday (February 10) for a Super Bowl that is expected to shatter viewership records in the U.S. and could be the most watched NFL game ever around the world.

The highly-anticipated match up between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs will be shown in 190 countries and is getting a boost from the U.S. State Department, which is hosting watch parties in more than 30 overseas locations.

Sports diplomacy is reaching new heights with U.S. embassies hosting watch parties everywhere from Chile and Cyprus to Rwanda, Turkmenistan and beyond.

The NFL on Friday continued to push into new markets by announcing it will play a first regular season game in Spain in 2025 at soccer side Real Madrid's Santiago Bernabeu stadium.

The league previously announced that it will also venture into South America for the first time next season with a game in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

Sao Paulo will be one of five international games next season along with three in London and one in Munich. NFL clubs have agreed to hold up to eight overseas games in 2025.

The NFL is also pushing hard to raise the profile of flag football, a discipline of the sport that is easier to access.

Flag football requires little protective equipment, with play stopping when a defender pulls a flag from the waist of an opponent, and is set to make its Olympic debut in Los Angeles in 2028.

15. DIVERSE FOTOS VON SCHLANGE STEHENDEN WAHLWILLIGEN

STORY: In einigen Berliner Bezirken hat am Sonntag die Wiederholungswahl zum Bundestag begonnen. Seit acht Uhr morgens können die Menschen in 455 Wahllokalen ihre Stimme abgeben. Insgesamt sind rund eine halbe Million Menschen zur Wahlwiederholung aufgerufen.

Die teilweise Wiederholung der Wahl vom September 2021 war notwendig geworden, weil das Bundesverfassungsgericht 2023 entsprechend geurteilt hatte. Bei der Bundestagswahl war es in Berlin zu zahlreichen Pannen gekommen. In Wahllokalen gab es teilweise zu wenige Wahlurnen oder es fehlten Stimmzettel. Einige Wahllokale schlossen zeitweise oder blieben noch nach 18.00 Uhr geöffnet. Das Verfassungsgericht beurteilte es vor allem als Wahlfehler, dass es teilweise zu wenige Wahlkabinen und Stimmzettel gab und dass es teils zu Wartezeiten von mehr als einer Stunde kam.

Mit einem grundlegenden Einfluss auf die aktuelle Zusammensetzung des Bundestages wird allerdings nicht gerechnet. Auch die Abgeordneten der aufgelösten Fraktion Die Linke müssen wohl nicht um ihren Verbleib im Bundestag fürchten: Sie sehen ihre Direktmandate nicht gefährdet. Bei einem bundesweiten Wahlergebnis von 4,9 Prozent gelang ihr der Wiedereinzug in den Bundestag 2021 nur, weil sie drei Direktmandate gewann - zwei davon in Berlin, wo Gregor Gysi und Gesine Lötzsch ihre Wahlkreise gewannen. Bei Verlust auch nur eines Direktmandats wären allen Linken nicht mehr im Bundestag.

Das vorläufige Ergebnis der Teilwiederholungswahl für das Land Berlin wird für den frühen Montagmorgen erwartet.

“Cutting off aid will hurt many people, not only me. For example, the treatments - today there are many diseases, and other things, so we need health (services) as well as education, this is very important. I’ve been living in this camp for 75 years.”

13. (SOUNDBITE) (Arabic) PALESTINIAN REFUGEE FROM DHEISHEH REFUGEE CAMP, LOAY ABDULGHAFAR, SAYING:

“The policy of sanctions that the Western world, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom are adopting is part of the policy of restricting UNRWA to end its work in the Palestinian territory. Of course, this will be within the context of an alternative plan or what is called Roadmap (previous peace plan) and to abolish the concept of a refugee. This will mainly have political implications because UNRWA provides few services whether health or educational or relief services, so there will be political implications more than anything else.”

“If they cut off aid from UNRWA, there will be no help of any kind for residents especially in refugee camps because they rely on UNRWA, there is no external aid, it’s obvious. Few workers go to Israel but now it’s (borders) closed because of the war.”

“For us, these are called allegations, they haven’t even reached the level of conclusive evidence. And to my knowledge we haven’t received anything written from the Israeli side. What happened is that we received these allegations, and the Commissioner general made the decision in favor of the agency to dismiss these colleagues and later on open an investigation to look into these allegations. Surprisingly, when we decided to speak to the media and say that we decided to open an investigation, some of the donor countries, not all of them of course, took the decision to suspend aid to UNRWA.”

“If the situation continues as it is, we inform you that there is liquidity in UNRWA only until the end of this month – February and possibly a few days in March. If the situation continues as it is, it is possible for UNRWA to be forced into the worst scenario, which is a nightmare for us, and it is to stop our operations not only in Gaza, in other locations where we operate, we operate in five other locations. This means that there are hundreds of thousands of students who will not receive their right of education in UNRWA schools – we have more that 700 schools in the regions where we operate – we have half a million students receiving education. This means that there are millions of medical consultations for those with illness and those in need that will not be available through our clinics, where we have dozens in our areas of operations. This means that in the Gaza Strip, a million and two hundred thousand people who were dependent on UNRWA for their food will no longer receive food.”

STORY: In refugee camps in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Palestinians relying on the U.N. agency UNRWA for schooling and healthcare fear key services will stop as donors have paused funding over accusations staff members took part in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack.

Most of the focus on the fate of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees has been on its emergency operations in war-devastated Gaza where it is critical to an aid effort for the enclave's 2.3 million inhabitants.

But the agency is also a lifeline for Palestinian refugees across the Middle East, including in the West Bank where it serves more than 870,000 people, running 96 schools and 43 primary healthcare facilities.

""If they cut off aid from UNRWA, there will be no help of any kind for residents, especially in refugee camps because they rely on UNRWA,"" said Mohammad al-Masri, a resident of Dheisheh refugee camp near Bethlehem.

UNRWA announced last month that it had dismissed staff after Israel presented it with allegations that 12 of its 13,000 employees in Gaza had taken part in the Oct. 7 assault by Hamas fighters who stormed border fences and attacked Israeli towns.

The Islamist militant group killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and dragged more than 250 back into Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's aerial and ground war in the Hamas-run enclave has killed more than 28,000 people there, health authorities there say.

Accusations against UNRWA have reignited longstanding Israeli demands to dismantle an agency which both sides see as closely linked to a refugee problem dating to Israel's creation in 1948 that lies at the heart of their decades-long conflict.

Some 700,000 Palestinians, half the Arab population of what 75 years ago was British-ruled Palestine, fled or were expelled, many spilling into neighboring Arab countries where they their descendants remain. The tent camps they lived in after 1948 evolved into built-up townships.

With no lasting settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict on the horizon, they retain the status of refugees, including in the West Bank and Gaza, and assert a right to return to their homes within Israel's borders.

Israel has always rejected that, saying they chose to leave and have no right to go back. Last month Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu renewed demands for UNRWA to be shut down, saying ""it seeks to preserve the issue of Palestinian refugees.""

Daoud Faraj was 10 years old when his family became refugees. Now 85, he has lived most of his life in the West Bank's Aida refugee camp near Jerusalem.

""Cutting off aid will hurt many people. Not only me,"" he said, referring to the health services and schools that UNRWA manages in the camp.

The agency has said it hopes donors will review their funding decisions in a few weeks after a preliminary report into Israeli accusations and UNRWA's handling of them.

It has said that it may run out of funds to operate services by the end of February if funding is not restored.

""It is possible for UNRWA to be forced into the worst scenario, which is a nightmare for us, and it is to stop our operations. Not only in Gaza, (but) in other locations where we operate,"" said agency spokesperson Kazem Abu Khalaf.

Outside UNRWA's West Bank operations hub in Jerusalem, the city's deputy mayor Aryeh King spoke at a protest by Israelis demanding that the agency be shuttered.

""It is time that the government of Israel decides to deal with this organization like an enemy,"" King said as demonstrators held up placards reading ""Expel UNRWA.""

Protesters, waving Palestinian flags and chanting in support of Gaza and against Israel, gathered at the end of the demonstration in front of the United Nations headquarters in central Beirut.

The conflict in Gaza began on Oct. 7 when Hamas gunmen stormed border defenses to attack Israeli towns, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel responded with a massive bombardment and ground offensive in which more than 28,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed, according to medical authorities in Hamas-run Gaza.

STORY: Israeli forces, backed by tanks and bulldozers, were seen operating along the Israel-Gaza border on Sunday (February 11) as smoke from Israeli air strikes billowed above the Strip.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it had ordered the military to develop a plan to evacuate Rafah and destroy four Hamas battalions it says are deployed there.

Most of the displaced have sought shelter in Rafah, on the border with Egypt, but after fruitless ceasefire talks, Netanyahu this week said Israeli forces would fight on until ""total victory.""

Israel's military ordered civilians to flee south before previous assaults on Gaza's cities, but now there is no obvious place to go and aid agencies have said many people could die.

The conflict in Gaza began on Oct. 7 when Hamas gunmen stormed border defences to attack Israeli towns, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.

Israel responded with a massive bombardment and ground offensive in which more than 28,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed, according to medical authorities in Hamas-run Gaza.

STORY: Hundreds of thousands of people chanted ""Death to Israel"" in rallies across Iran to mark the Islamic Revolution's 45th anniversary on Sunday (February 11), with some burning U.S. and Israeli flags amid the ongoing war between Israel and Tehran-backed Hamas.

President Ebrahim Raisi, in a televised speech, accused Tehran's arch-foe the United States and some Western countries of backing ""the Zionist regime's (Israel) crimes against humanity in Gaza"".

Israel's four-month-old war on Palestinian Islamist group Hamas in Gaza has rippled across the Middle East, with groups backed by Iran mounting attacks on Israeli and U.S. targets.

Backing the Palestinian cause has been a pillar of the Islamic Republic since the revolution that overthrew the U.S.-backed shah, and a way for the Shi'ite-dominated country to fashion itself as a leader of the Muslim world.

Hamas is part of Iran's ""Axis of Resistance"", a regional alliance that includes Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, Shi'ite militia groups in Iraq and the Houthis who control a large part of Yemen.

Israeli aerial strikes hit Khan Younis as Rafah braces for all-out offensive
VIDEO SHOWS: EXPLOSIONS AND SMOKE DURING ISRAELI GROUND OPERATION IN KHAN YOUNIS, AS SEEN FROM CAMP FOR DISPLACED PEOPLE IN RAFAH

RESENDING WITH COMPLETE SCRIPT

SHOWS: RAFAH, GAZA (FEBRUARY 11, 2024) (REUTERS - Access All)

1. BLACK SMOKE BILLOWING AFTER EXPLOSION IN KHAN YOUNIS, AS SEEN FROM CAMP FOR DISPLACED PEOPLE IN RAFAH (TC: 1057 GMT)

2. SMOKE RISING (TC: 0915 GMT)

3. TENTS OF DISPLACED PALESTINIANS, EXPLOSION AND SMOKE IN DISTANCE (TC: 0838 GMT)

8. VARIOUS OF BLACK SMOKE RISING (TC: 0922 GMT)

9. VARIOUS OF RAFAH DISPLACEMENT CAMP, EXPLOSION IN DISTANCE (TC: 1115 GMT)

STORY: Explosions and smoke from the Israeli ground operation in Khan Younis were seen on Sunday (February 11) from a camp for displaced people in Gaza's Rafah, as over a million Palestinians crammed into the city awaited a full-scale offensive.

Any Israeli ground offensive in Rafah on the Gaza border will ""blow up"" the hostage exchange negotiations,"" Hamas-run Aqsa Television channel quoted a senior Hamas leader as saying on Sunday.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it had ordered the military to develop a plan to evacuate Rafah and destroy four Hamas battalions it says are deployed there.

Most of the displaced have sought shelter in Rafah, on the border with Egypt, but after fruitless ceasefire talks, Netanyahu this week said Israeli forces would fight on until ""total victory.""

Israel's military ordered civilians to flee south before previous assaults on Gaza's cities, but now there is no obvious place to go and aid agencies have said many people could die.

STORY: Britain's King Charles attended church on Sunday (February 11) in his first public outing since announcing last week he had been diagnosed with cancer and would postpone some engagements to undergo treatment.

The king, wearing a brown overcoat and carrying an umbrella, waved as he arrived with his wife, Camilla, at St Mary Magdalene church in Sandringham in eastern England.

Buckingham Palace announced on Monday (February 5) that Charles, 75, had been diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer. The king has been on the throne for less than 18 months following the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth.

Charles, who is spending time at his rural Sandringham estate, issued a message on Saturday (February 10) expressing gratitude to well-wishers following his diagnosis.

While undergoing treatment, Charles has postponed public engagements but is planning to continue with much of his private work as monarch including having his weekly audience with the prime minister and dealing with state papers.

STORY: Britain's King Charles attended church on Sunday (February 11) in his first public outing since announcing last week he had been diagnosed with cancer and would postpone some engagements to undergo treatment.

The king, wearing a brown overcoat and carrying an umbrella, waved as he arrived with his wife, Camilla, at St Mary Magdalene church in Sandringham in eastern England.

Buckingham Palace announced on Monday (February 5) that Charles, 75, had been diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer. The king has been on the throne for less than 18 months following the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth.

Charles, who is spending time at his rural Sandringham estate, issued a message on Saturday (February 10) expressing gratitude to well-wishers following his diagnosis.

While undergoing treatment, Charles has postponed public engagements but is planning to continue with much of his private work as monarch including having his weekly audience with the prime minister and dealing with state papers.","['ARTS', 'CULTURE', 'ENTERTAINMENTEUROPEROYALS']",9587,6,,Broadcast: Part no use UK.

""Well the campaign has been extremely lively and the second round has been, meaning that people really gather around the candidate and come to the meetings. We have had this gasoline station campaign, you know that one of the important parts of the Finnish democracy are the gasoline station parliaments where people gather and discuss all the issues and it has been extremely successful. Last night our last gasoline station was in Teisko or Teiskontie in Tampere and people couldn't fill in and a couple of hundreds of people came to a gasoline station meeting so it shows that the campaign has been extremely successful. And also yesterday at the Lahti market square and so forth, it was fully packed. So a very successful campaign, people are really joining - How do you feel Antonio?"" / (SOUNDBITE)(English) HAAVISTO'S HUSBAND, ANTONIO FLORES, SAYING:

""Well the campaign was actually really great. I mean we were travelling around Finland pretty much everywhere and it was really nice just to interact with a lot of people, like young people, older people, all different kind of ages, backgrounds and that was actually really nice. Like Pekka just said, we were just stopping at any gas station and it was just incredible to see how many people, how much people were actually around and they all wanted to come and greet us. There were a lot of people that probably in the past would have never voted for the Greens or for Pekka but this time they were just happy to come and say we are coming and voting for you.""/ (SOUNDBITE)(English) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE PEKKA HAAVISTO, SAYING:

(Reporter asking: Mr Haavisto, what do you expect from tonight's results?)

""Well it will be an interesting night and a lot depends (on) how is the voting activity today and who are those who have activated themselves to vote. So we hope the best performance of this voting day and of course encourage each and everyone to vote and use their power to choose the president of Finland for the next six years.""

STORY: Finnish presidential candidate Pekka Haavisto on Sunday (February 11) cast his vote in an election in which his opponent Alexander Stubb is the frontrunner according to opinion polls.

Haavisto, a former foreign minister and member of the liberal Green Party, cast his vote in a school in Helsinki with his husband Antonio Flores.

""We hope the best performance of this voting day and of course encourage each and everyone to vote and use their power to choose the president of Finland for the next six years,"" Haavisto said afterwards, adding that he thought his campaign had been ""extremely successful"".

Stubb, a former prime minister of the centre-right National Coalition Party, won the first round of the election on January 28 with 27.2% of the ballots, ahead of Haavisto on 25.8%. He has also beaten Haavisto in surveys, most recently by 6-8 percentage points.

Both candidates are pro-European and strong supporters of Ukraine, having taken a tough stance towards Russia in their campaigns.

The new president will have a central role in defining Finland's NATO policies, while leading on overall foreign and security policy in close cooperation with the government and acting as a commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

If Haavisto, running for president for a third time, achieves a surprise win, he would become Finland's first openly gay president. His sexual orientation remains a factor for voters, however, with recent polls showing one in three saw the fact that he has a male partner as a reason not to back him.

Nearly 46% of those eligible to vote cast their ballots ahead of Sunday, official data showed, with the first results from advance votes due to be published shortly after polls close at 1800 GMT. The winner is expected to be announced around 2100 GMT.

STORY: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has appointed Oleksandr Pavliuk, former first deputy defence minister, as the new commander of Ukraine's ground forces, according to a decree published on Sunday (February 11).

Pavliuk, a lieutenant-general who served in the ministry role for a year, replaces Col. Gen. Oleksandr Syrskyi after he was tapped this week as commander of Ukraine's armed forces.

On Saturday (February 10), Zelenskiy announced five other senior military appointments, filling out a rebooted team to bolster Ukraine's defence against Russia's nearly two-year-old invasion.

Ukraine is experiencing a shortage of men and equipment as it heads into 2024 having made few battlefield gains throughout the past year. It also faces a disruption in military aid from the United States, its biggest backer.

STORY: An elephant that escaped South Africa's Kruger National Park (KNP) on Saturday (February 10) had to be euthanised after locals from a neighbouring community chased it, local media reported.

Eyewitness footage showed residents from Matsulu in the northern province of Mpumalanga running towards the elephant, shouting and whistling.

According to local media, the Mpumalanga Tourism and Parks Agency (MTPA) worked with the KNP to dispatch a helicopter, but it had to be withdrawn as community members had threatened the team on the ground, and the crowd could not be controlled.

After the elephant was euthanised, residents were warned to stay away from wildlife that enters Matsulu, and were advised not to plant mango or avocado trees near the fence that separates the community from the park.

STORY: Pope Francis on Sunday (February 11) elevated to sainthood the first female saint from his native Argentina, an event that brought to the Vatican his former vocal critic, President Javier Milei.

Milei, a maverick right-wing libertarian, had - before he ran for president - insulted Francis but has softened his tone since taking office in December.

The pope, for his part, has said he did not pay too much attention to the insults, telling Mexican broadcaster N+ that what matters is what politicians do in office, rather than on the campaign trail.

Francis led a canonisation Mass in St. Peter's Basilica for Maria Antonia de Paz y Figueroa, better known as ""Mama Antula,"" an 18th century consecrated lay woman who renounced her family's riches to focus on charity and Jesuit spiritual exercises.

The ceremony came as Argentina faces its worst economic crisis in decades, with inflation at more than 200%, and the newly installed Milei in difficulty following parliamentary rejection of a major reform package.

Milei had a front row seat for the service, and at the end of it, exchanged a few words with the pope, as they shook hands and hugged. The president is due to have a private audience with Francis on Monday (February 12).

STORY: An environmental expert group visited the Chornobyl exclusion zone in Ukraine on Saturday (February 10) inspecting damage done by Russian troops in the first month of the invasion in 2022.

Russian forces occupied the defunct power station north of Kyiv soon after invading Ukraine on Feb. 24 2022 but had left the plant amid a withdrawal from Ukraine's north.

They had built fortifications including trenches in the so-called Red Forest, the most radioactively contaminated part of the zone around Chornobyl, Ukraine's state nuclear company Energoatom said.

The exclusion zone was established because of high radiation levels in the area after a nuclear reactor exploded at the plant in April 1986.

The group's co-chair and former Swedish foreign minister Margot Wallstrom and several other members of the 12-person group were in Kyiv on Friday (February 9) to discuss a report how the war affects Ukraine's environment.

The international group, established last year by Ukraine's presidential administration to investigate issues ranging from nuclear safety to soil pollution, unveiled 50 recommendations aimed at tracking damage from the nearly two-year invasion, holding Russia accountable and charting a green recovery.

STORY: The Directors Guild of America (DGA) held a glitzy awards ceremony in Beverly Hills on Saturday (February 10) to recognize the top directorial achievements of 2023, ahead of the movie world's top honors, the Oscars, in March.

The nominees for the top award of outstanding directorial achievement in theatrical feature film are Greta Gerwig for 'Barbie', Yorgos Lanthimos for 'Poor Things', Christopher Nolan for 'Oppenheimer', Alexander Payne for 'The Holdovers' and Martin Scorsese for 'Killers of the Flower Moon'.

Korean-Canadian director Celine Song was nominated in the category of first-time theatrical feature film for her modern romance 'Past Lives.' She said being recognized by her peers was special.

""It is such an honor to just be here among so many amazing directors that I've admired forever,"" she said.

The DGA is the leading industry group representing film and television directors. Past DGA feature film award winners have often gone on to claim the best director Oscar and see their films win best picture from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

The Oscars will be handed out in Hollywood on March 10 to producers, directors, actors and actresses in a star-studded television show viewed around the world and among the most-watched TV programs in the United States.

The nominees for the top award of outstanding directorial achievement in theatrical feature film are Greta Gerwig for 'Barbie', Yorgos Lanthimos for 'Poor Things', Christopher Nolan for 'Oppenheimer', Alexander Payne for 'The Holdovers' and Martin Scorsese for 'Killers of the Flower Moon'.

Korean-Canadian director Celine Song was nominated in the category of first-time theatrical feature film for her modern romance 'Past Lives.' She said being recognized by her peers was special.

""It is such an honor to just be here among so many amazing directors that I've admired forever,"" she said.

The DGA is the leading industry group representing film and television directors. Past DGA feature film award winners have often gone on to claim the best director Oscar and see their films win best picture from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

The Oscars will be handed out in Hollywood on March 10 to producers, directors, actors and actresses in a star-studded television show viewed around the world and among the most-watched TV programs in the United States."

VIDEO SHOWS: PLANE BELIEVED TO BE CARRYING TAYLOR SWIFT MOVING AT LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

SHOWS: LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES (FEBRUARY 10, 2024) (ABC AFFILIATE KABC - No use USA. No archive.)

1. PLANE BELIEVED TO BE TRANSPORTING SINGER, TAYLOR SWIFT, LANDING AT LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

STORY: A private plane believed to be carrying pop megastar Taylor Swift landed at Los Angeles International Airport on Saturday (February 10) afternoon, media reports said.

She is expected to head for the Super Bowl in Las Vegas on Sunday (February 11), in which she will cheer on her boyfriend Travis Kelce and his team the Kansas City Chiefs when they take on the San Francisco 49ers.

Swift arrived after finishing the Japan leg of her ""The Eras Tour"" with a sold-out concert in Tokyo and, thanks to favourable time zone changes, appears to have made it back to the U.S. in plenty of time for the Super Bowl.

Swift has attended 12 Chiefs games since she began dating Kelce last year, boosting the already sky-high National Football League (NFL) ratings.

STORY: Tommy Hilfiger took over the historic ""Oyster Bar"" inside Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal on Friday (February 9) to debut his Fall/Winter 2024 collection at New York Fashion Week: The Shows.

The New Yorker said he wanted an iconic backdrop to showcase the new line.

“The Oyster Bar we thought was a very interesting place to show and invite guests who are maybe not from New York and have never been there. Because it is sort of a hidden secret,"" said Hilfiger.

Models weaved through the restaurant in the brand’s signature style - American classic cool.

“You're going to see preppy, sporty, fun, but elevated, more sophisticated, more polished, more refined. You're going to see, some red, white and blue from our favorite palette.”

The line featured a tasteful array of red, white, and blue, a nod to the brand's staple palette, while infusing contemporary elegance into every piece.

Camel and navy were used on pieces with a nod to nautical and military aesthetics.

Questlove deejayed at the show and singer Jon Batiste closed it with a performance of his song “Freedom”.

Nearly 50 brands including Carolina Herrera, Tommy Hilfiger and Brandon Maxwell will showcase their collections during New York Fashion Week: The Shows, which runs until Wednesday (February 14).

STORY: Tommy Hilfiger took over the historic ""Oyster Bar"" inside Manhattan's Grand Central Terminal on Friday (February 9) to debut his Fall/Winter 2024 collection at New York Fashion Week: The Shows.

The New Yorker said he wanted an iconic backdrop to showcase the new line.

“The Oyster Bar we thought was a very interesting place to show and invite guests who are maybe not from New York and have never been there. Because it is sort of a hidden secret,"" said Hilfiger.

Models weaved through the restaurant in the brand’s signature style - American classic cool.

“You're going to see preppy, sporty, fun, but elevated, more sophisticated, more polished, more refined. You're going to see, some red, white and blue from our favorite palette.”

The line featured a tasteful array of red, white, and blue, a nod to the brand's staple palette, while infusing contemporary elegance into every piece.

Camel and navy were used on pieces with a nod to nautical and military aesthetics.

Questlove deejayed at the show and singer Jon Batiste closed it with a performance of his song “Freedom”.

STORY: The world's biggest carnival bash kicked off on Friday night (February 9) as musicians and dancers paraded their way through Rio de Janeiro's Sambadrome.

People were dressed in all kinds of creative costumes with some some showing a little skin, with everyone dancing to the samba beat of the drum lines.

The Sambadrome is the venue for a competition judged on elements such as choreography, atmosphere, organisation, and singing. While the processions are famous for their festive atmosphere, the competition between samba schools is fierce.

Every year, hundreds of street bands and revelers descend on Rio during four days of celebrations and elaborate parades in Rio's Sambadrome. The Rio de Janeiro Carnival 2024 will run until February 12.

STORY: A Yamaha grand piano… a signed pinball machine.... and silver platform boots emblazoned with an “E” and a “J”... These objects are among the 950 items belonging to music legend Sir Elton John that will hit the auction block in New York City later this month..

“The last time we had a sale for Elton John was in 2001. And we sold some of his cars in the U.K. But this is the first time in 25 years that he's had an exercise like this with us,” said Tash Perrin, Deputy Chairman, Americas at Christie's.

The one-of-a-kind pieces come from the superstar’s former Atlanta home on Peachtree Road.

Christie’s estimates the collection sale could bring in more than $10 million.

The series of three live auctions and six online auctions will begin on February 21.

STORY: Veteran designer Tadashi Shoji nodded to the natural world for his latest collection at New York Fashion Week on Friday, presenting an array of cocktail dresses and evening gowns in dark greens and bronzes.

Instead of a catwalk show, Japanese-born Shoji, who is based in Los Angeles, chose to present the Fall/Winter 2024 line digitally via video, which showed models walking through an enchanted forest set to present the frocks.

Many dresses bore leaf or floral motifs and embroidery. Some were adorned with large floral decorations.

""(There) is so much tragedy and so much chaos (in the world), so mostly, psychologically I think... people want to escape from this mess,"" Shoji told Reuters.

""So (I thought) maybe a green forest, the fantasy of a forest (was) a good idea.""

Nearly 50 brands including Carolina Herrera, Tommy Hilfiger, and Brandon Maxwell will showcase their collections during New York Fashion Week: The Shows, which runs until Feb. 14.

    “So you see a lot of just drop dead gorgeous textiles and a kind of elevated, you can call it a skate or a surf look, right? Because we came up that way in Gen X, we came up that way. What you're also seeing is a system. It's not easy dressing well. And so, every outfit you see up there, everything you see, these color plans are already made. Our guys go to the website or they talk to our consultants and they pick a color plan they like, and then it's kind of done for them, right?

STORY: New York Fashion Week: The Shows officially kicked off on Friday (February 9) with four menswear designers showcasing their new collections.

    Designer and tailor Jack Sivan is making his debut with his own brand focused on fun, soft and playful tailoring.

    “It's very focused on traditional menswear, and the techniques and the references. But very much interested in the future of menswear more than the past,” said Sivan.

    Menswear brand Y.Chroma launched less than a year ago with a mission to transform the modern man, particularly those in the age bracket where wisdom meets the desire for style.

    “My customers are in their 40s, but many of them are in their 50s and 60s. They all woke up to the fact that they're going to live to be around 100 years old. They look in line at Starbucks and realize they're wearing the same clothes as every other guy, and they want to change that. That's actually not an easy transition to make,” said founder Max Israel.

    Israel said the brand taps into Generation X's heritage—infusing the laid-back essence of skate and surf culture with luxurious textiles and refined aesthetics.

        “This matters because you're talking about 100 million men between the U.S. and Europe. They're most of GDP, and they're totally locked out of fashion. They're not welcome in fashion. My guys are gorgeous, right? Look at them, right? Average age is 50. Average age of the model everywhere else in the building is like 19. So, it's not selling to my customer. We're going to change that,” explained Israel.

    Terry Singh returned with his fourth collection that he said celebrates his customer’s personal identity.

    The New York based designer continued his tradition of using unconventional models.

    Singh met Brian St. John, who is a vice president at a major record label, on the street in New York.

    “Terry was directing my friend how to take the pictures better and angling it better. And then we exchanged Instagrams and… he hit me up and asked me to be in the show.”

    Fashion brand Landeros also showed during the morning session of the biannual Men's Day event.

    Nearly 50 brands including Carolina Herrera, Tommy Hilfiger and Brandon Maxwell will showcase their collections during New York Fashion Week: The Shows, which runs until Wednesday.

MOMENT: Piers Morgan says Prince Harry should stop invading royal family's privacy
VIDEO SHOWS: BROADCASTER AND FORMER DAILY MIRROR EDITOR PIERS MORGAN APPROACHING PRESS IN FRONT OF HIS HOUSE / SOUNDBITE FROM MORGAN

RESENDING WITH COMPLETE SCRIPT

SHOWS: LONDON, ENGLAND, UNITED KINGDOM (FEBRUARY 9, 2024) (BBC NEWS - No use UK)

1. BROADCASTER AND FORMER DAILY MIRROR EDITOR PIERS MORGAN APPROACHING PRESS IN FRONT OF HIS HOUSE / SAYING (English): ""Good afternoon.""

2. (SOUNDBITE) (English) BROADCASTER AND FORMER DAILY MIRROR EDITOR, PIERS MORGAN, SAYING:

""Invading the privacy of the royal family is utterly reprehensible and on that I share Prince Harry's opinion. I just wish he'd stop doing it.""

STORY: High-profile British broadcaster and former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan on Friday (February 9) called the invasion of the royal family's privacy ""reprehensible"" and added that he wished Prince Harry would ""stop doing it"".

Prince Harry said on Friday his mission to purge the press would continue ""through to the end"" after he accepted substantial damages to settle his case against Mirror Group Newspapers.

He also delivered another broadside against Morgan, a former Daily Mirror editor, who Judge Timothy Fancourt concluded was among senior figures who had known about the ""widespread"" unlawful behaviour.

Morgan, now one of the most prominent and vocal critics of Harry and Meghan, says he has never hacked a phone nor told anybody else to do so.

""I totally agree with Prince Harry that ruthless intrusion into the private lives of the Royal Family for financial gain is utterly reprehensible … and I hope he stops doing it,"" Morgan told reporters in London.

In December, the High Court in London ruled that Harry had been a victim of unlawful information gathering, including phone-hacking, by journalists on the Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and Sunday People tabloids with the knowledge of their editors.

Fancourt ruled that about half the stories he examined were the result of unlawful acts and awarded the prince - the first British royal for 130 years to give evidence when he appeared as a witness last June - 140,600 pounds ($177,170) in damages.

That trial had only considered 33 of 148 articles put forward by Harry's legal team, and on Friday his lawyer David Sherborne told a High Court hearing MGN had now agreed to pay further substantial damages and his legal costs, of at least 400,000, to settle the outstanding claims.

In a statement, King Charles' younger son said the settlement had vindicated his claims about the newspapers' behaviour.

""Everything we said was happening at Mirror Group was in fact happening, and indeed far worse as the Court ruled in its extremely damning judgement,"" he said in a statement read outside court by his lawyer.

""As I said back in December, our mission continues,"" his statement said. ""It is the very reason why I started this, and why I will continue to see it through to the end.""

Harry was not in court for Friday's hearing, having made a flying trip to Britain earlier this week to see his father after the king had been diagnosed with a form of cancer. They were able to meet for under an hour on Tuesday (February 6) before Charles left London for his home in eastern England where he is recuperating as he undergoes outpatient treatment.

Harry, estranged from his family after his criticism of them and the monarchy, left the following day for California.

History, here in Bastogne but also more widely in World War Two, has shown that very clearly.""

STORY: The room in Belgium where a U.S. army officer helped turn around the country’s bloodiest battle of World War Two – and refused to surrender with a now legendary expletive – has been opened to the public for the first time.

Heavily outnumbered by German forces during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, General Anthony McAuliffe received a call to surrender to which he replied simply “Nuts!” and entering U.S. military folklore.

Now a museum in southern Belgium has restored the headquarters formerly home to the 101st Airborne Division and opened it as part of an exhibition celebrating the 80th anniversary of the battle.

The Bastogne War Rooms includes an immersive exhibition space as well as a visit to McAuliffe’s cellar in an unremarkable barracks in the wooded Ardennes region.

German forces initially took the Allies by surprise in the attack, their last major offensive of the war, and battle-fatigued and inexperienced U.S. forces lost approximately 19,000 troops.

For Belgians, the Bulge is a testament to the sacrifice made by U.S. soldiers in the liberation of Western Europe from Nazi occupation.

As the U.S. government struggles to pass a 61 billion dollar aid bill for Ukraine and with likely presidential nominee Donald Trump a stern critic of the NATO military alliance, the mayor of Bastogne told Reuters the message of transatlantic cooperation has never been more important.

“It's the best defence we can have, our greatest protection. History, here in Bastogne but also more widely in World War Two, has shown that very clearly,” he said.

STORY: Die Vorbereitungen auf die 74. Internationalen Filmfestspiele in Berlin laufen auf Hochtouren. Wie jedes Jahr verwandelt sich das Theater am Potsdamer Platz in den Berlinale Palast, weithin sichtbar durch das Bären-Logo an der Glasfassade. Dort, wo ab kommenden Donnerstag die Gäste der Wettbewerbsfilme über den Roten Teppich schreiten werden, wurde am Freitag das überdimensionale Markenzeichen montiert.

Insgesamt konkurrieren 20 Beiträge um den Goldenen Bären, der von einer Jury unter der Leitung der kenianisch-mexikanischen Schauspielerin Lupita Nyong'o verliehen wird.

Im irisch-belgischen Eröffnungsfilm „Small Things Like These“ wird der Ire Cilian Murphy zu sehen sein. Der Wettbewerbsbeitrag ist ein historisches Drama über religiöse Unterdrückung im ländlichen Irland. Für seine Rolle in ""Oppenheimer"" wurde Murphy jüngst mit einem Golden Globe als bester männlicher Darsteller ausgezeichnet und für den Oscar nominiert.

Auch Deutschland ist im Wettbewerb vertreten, unter anderem mit „In Liebe, Eure Hilde“ von Andreas Dresen mit Liv Lisa Fries.

Auch die Sektion Berlinale Special wird für Glamour auf dem roten Teppich sorgen. Kristen Stewart wird mit „Love Lies Bleeding“ von Rose Glass erwartet, Adam Sandler wird in „Spaceman“ von Johan Renck zu sehen sein.

Am 20. Februar werden die Festivalorganisatoren Martin Scorsese mit einem Goldenen Ehrenbären für sein Lebenswerk für seine Verdienste um das Kino auszeichnen.

Die 74. Ausgabe der Berliner Filmfestspiele findet vom 15. bis 25. Februar statt.

Für seine Rolle in ""Oppenheimer"" wurde Murphy jüngst mit einem Golden Globe als bester männlicher Darsteller ausgezeichnet und für den Oscar nominiert.

Auch Deutschland ist im Wettbewerb vertreten, unter anderem mit „In Liebe, Eure Hilde“ von Andreas Dresen mit Liv Lisa Fries.

Auch die Sektion Berlinale Special wird für Glamour auf dem roten Teppich sorgen. Kristen Stewart wird mit „Love Lies Bleeding“ von Rose Glass erwartet, Adam Sandler wird in „Spaceman“ von Johan Renck zu sehen sein.

Am 20. Februar werden die Festivalorganisatoren Martin Scorsese mit einem Goldenen Ehrenbären für sein Lebenswerk für seine Verdienste um das Kino auszeichnen.

Die 74. Ausgabe der Berliner Filmfestspiele findet vom 15. bis 25. Februar statt.

(Produktion: Martin Schlicht, Claudia Dörries)

STORY: Forty former cover stars including Kate Moss, Miley Cyrus, Jodie Comer, Oprah Winfrey and Jane Fonda have come together to pose for designer Edward Enninful's final outing as editor-in-chief of British Vogue.

The famous group gathered in December 2023 in New York to pose for the front cover of the fashion magazine's March edition.

""So here it is: my 76th and final edition of Vogue, six and a half years and 153 cover stars later, including the 40 legendary women who feature on this cover. It’s been an extraordinary ride and an absolute honour,'' Enninful said in press release.

Model and actor Anya Taylor-Joy said: ''If we're all standing together, we stand taller and prouder.''

Enninful is stepping into a new role at media company Conde Nast as creative and cultural advisor for Vogue.

""I'm determined to keep championing the incredible array of voices in fashion and media, and ensure we keep the energy explosion of the last few years going,"" he said.

Enniful's first British Vogue issue hit news-stands in November 2017, with his first issue featuring British Ghanaian model and activist Adwoa Aboah on the cover.

Ghanaian-born Enninful, who took over from Alexandra Shulman, was the first male editor in the publication's 100-year history.

""This is only the third time it's sung at the Super Bowl, which I love that they brought it back again this year. It's the second time televised. Obviously, the great Alicia Keys, the great Sheryl Lee Ralph have done it before me. And I think when kids see it, I hope familiarity starts to build. I hope the song is not a foreign thing or something that's othered, if that makes sense. I hope that it just becomes a part of the pantheon of just great, you know, great music, great American music, great music.

15. END OF NEWS CONFERENCE

STORY: American singer Andra Day may have won a Grammy, a Golden Globe, and even been nominated for an Academy Award for best actress, but the singer and actress says her latest accolade - being chosen to perform at the beginning of the Super Bowl - is by far the most prestigious.

Speaking to Reuters, Day said ""Well, it's definitely the biggest audience I have ever and probably will ever perform for so yeah, it definitely ranks up there - as far as like magnitude - definitely top, definitely number one in reach and all that so and just the history. I think the legacy and performing this particular song feels like just truly an honor and something I've always wanted to do so it's definitely a dream come true.""

Day is best known for her anthemic song 'Rise Up', which she performed at the White House for President Obama. She also performed the song 'Stand Up for Something' at the 2017 Oscars.

But she still gets nervous.

""I just think of it. I think of it all the time. I'm inundated with thoughts of it. No, I mean, the main thing that I do, I'm a praying person, so I pray a lot,"" she said.

For the Super Bowl, Day will sing 'Lift Every Voice and Sing', which is often referred to as the Black National Anthem. But Day believes it should resonate with everyone.

Day said ""This is a truly universal song about liberty and about victory and about overcoming, you know, and I think that whether that's as a society or as a culture or your own personal battle of your own personal struggles, I think it's, you know, I think it will really resonate with people when they really pay attention to what the song's actually saying.""

Speaking to Reuters, Day said ""Well, it's definitely the biggest audience I have ever and probably will ever perform for so yeah, it definitely ranks up there - as far as like magnitude - definitely top, definitely number one in reach and all that so and just the history. I think the legacy and performing this particular song feels like just truly an honor and something I've always wanted to do so it's definitely a dream come true.""

Day is best known for her anthemic song 'Rise Up', which she performed at the White House for President Obama. She also performed the song 'Stand Up for Something' at the 2017 Oscars.

But she still gets nervous.

""I just think of it. I think of it all the time. I'm inundated with thoughts of it. No, I mean, the main thing that I do, I'm a praying person, so I pray a lot,"" she said.

For the Super Bowl, Day will sing 'Lift Every Voice and Sing', which is often referred to as the Black National Anthem. But Day believes it should resonate with everyone.

Day said ""This is a truly universal song about liberty and about victory and about overcoming, you know, and I think that whether that's as a society or as a culture or your own personal battle of your own personal struggles, I think it's, you know, I think it will really resonate with people when they really pay attention to what the song's actually saying."""

22. DAY, MCENTIRE AND POST MALONE

STORY: Grammy-winning artist Usher said on Thursday (February 8) it was ""a new beginning"" for him to headline the halftime show at the 2024 Super Bowl in Las Vegas.

The pop and R&B artist, who finished a 100-show Las Vegas residency in December, said his 13-minute performance would feature roller-skating and a selection of music from his 30-year career.

""I was very mindful of my past, celebrating my present, which is here in Las Vegas, and thinking about where we're headed in the future. And that was really the idea. What songs do I feel people know me for? What songs have been a celebration of all of the journey, of what life in love and emotion has been offered in my music,"" he said at a discussion hosted by Apple Music.

Since the release of his debut album in 1994, the 45-year-old singer has sold over 80 million records worldwide and won eight Grammy awards.

Before Sunday's (February 11) big game, country artist Reba McEntire will sing the national anthem and rapper Post Malone will sing ""America the Beautiful."" Soul singer Andra Day will perform ""Lift Every Voice and Sing,"" a hymn the NAACP calls the Black national anthem.

The 58th Super Bowl will take place at Las Vegas' Allegiant Stadium on Feb. 11, 2024.

STORY: Britain's King Charles is doing ""extremely well,"" his wife Queen Camilla said on Thursday (February 8), in her first public engagement since the 75-year-old monarch was diagnosed with cancer.

Speaking to a well-wisher at a charity concert at Salisbury Cathedral in southern England, Camilla said Charles was touched by the messages of support from the public.

Charles' son and heir to the throne, Prince William, on Wednesday, thanked the British public for their kind messages both about his father as well as his wife Kate following her recent surgery.

Kate, 42, underwent planned abdominal surgery on Jan. 16 and then spent two weeks in hospital recovering.

Since then, Charles has undergone treatment for an enlarged prostate, before Buckingham Palace announced on Monday that subsequent tests on the monarch had revealed he had a form of cancer.

With the king postponing public duties to undergo outpatient treatment and Kate not expected to return to engagements until after Easter, the onus is on the remaining royals, especially William and Camilla, to provide the public face of the monarchy.

37. EXCERPT FROM TRAILER OF CIRQUE DU SOLEIL SHOW 'ALEGRIA: IN A NEW LIGHT'

STORY: London's National Centre for Circus Arts held a series of workshops on Thursday (February 8), led by the cast of Cirque du Soleil's latest London show “Alegria: In a New Light”.

The collaboration between Cirque du Soleil and the National Centre for Circus Arts offered aspiring student circus performers the opportunity to practise their skills in trapeze, banquine, and contortion.

""I think why people still come and watch circus is that you see real human beings pushing forward the limits of the human body and achieving feats that you wouldn't think would be possible,” said Senior Publicist of Cirque du Soleil’s show ""Alegria – In a New Light.”

Two cast members from the show also became Guinness World Records title holders on Thursday for the most contortion roll push-ups in 30 seconds, following successful attempts in London earlier this month.

One of the World Record holders, Oyun-Erdene Senge, who taught students in the contortionist workshop, said of her achievement, “It was a really cool, opportunity to challenge myself because, you know, I do push-ups, almost every day. So this is really fun.”

Cirque du Soleil's new show 'Alegría – In A New Light' will run until March 3rd at the Royal Albert Hall.

STORY: On the eve of the official start of Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, tourists got a glimpse of the city's iconic Sambadrome on Thursday (February 8) before it lights up for a samba spectacular.

The parade competition, which starts on Friday (February 9), is one of the top attractions of the annual Carnival celebrations that sweep the city every year.

Workers were hard at work putting the finishing touches to the 78,000-seat samba stadium.

The Sambadrome was designed by world-renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Neimeyer in 1984, just five months before that year's Carnival. Parades had been held before at the famed Maracana soccer stadium.

STORY: On the eve of the official start of Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, tourists got a glimpse of the city's iconic Sambadrome on Thursday (February 8) before it lights up for a samba spectacular.

The parade competition, which starts on Friday (February 9), is one of the top attractions of the annual Carnival celebrations that sweep the city every year.

Workers were hard at work putting the finishing touches to the 78,000-seat samba stadium.

The Sambadrome was designed by world-renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Neimeyer in 1984, just five months before that year's Carnival. Parades had been held before at the famed Maracana soccer stadium.","['ARTS', 'CULTURE', 'ENTERTAINMENTSOUTH AMERICA', 'CENTRAL AMERICA']",9075,5,,Broadcast: None. Digital: None..

With other common breeds of chicken, farmers only have to raise them for about a few months (before they're fully grown). But for Dong Tao chicken, it has to be raised for more than a year. The older it gets, the bigger the legs become, until it looks like this. The chicken I'm holding in my hand is two years old. So the older it gets, the bigger its legs get, as well as that chicken’s market value. It's expensive mainly because of these feet.""

""In the process of raising this chicken, with legs that are huge like this, I have to assist them. Because the chicken's feet are too big, they will not be able to mate and reproduce on their own. We have to extract sperm from a male and inject it into an appropriately-aged female to let it fertilise and produce the best quality, most beautiful chicken. The only difficult part of the breeding process is that if breeding were to happen naturally, we will not end up with the best result in terms of gene selection. Otherwise, there is no other problem given their large feet. Even with legs this size, they move normally just like other chickens. It's very easy to raise, not difficult at all.""

But for this chicken's meat to be sweet and carry a distinctive fragrance, it must be at least 10 months old to more than a year old for the meat to be extremely delicious.

STORY: Vietnam’s Dong Tao chicken is not your average broiler chicken.

With abnormally bulky, large, and scaly legs, they are also known as 'dragon feet' chicken and for generations have been a delicacy in Vietnam.

Weighing up to 6 kg (13 lbs) when fully grown, the birds are believed to bring good fortune and wealth to their owners, and are a popular gift during Lunar New Year, or Tet, as it is called in Vietnam.

At the rural Dong Tao village about 30 kilometres (18.6 miles) southeast of Hanoi, where the birds are exclusively bred, poultry farmer Nguyen Thi Hong Nhung is the third generation in her family to produce the special breed of chicken.

She said even though the 'dragon feet' chickens are easy to raise as they consume the same feed as regular chickens, their highly-prized legs and feet require extra attention.

The birds – named after Dong Tao village where they originate – have to be raised for more than a year before they’re fit for sale, said Nhung.

The older they get, the larger their legs grow. “It’s expensive mainly because of these legs,” she said while holding up a chicken and showing off its palm-sized legs.

A Dong Tao hen will produce around 100 eggs a year, which farmers separate from the birds to prevent them from crushing the eggs under their weight. Roosters have their own pens to prevent them from fighting and injuring each other, causing wounds.

Today, demand for the special chickens – formerly reserved for royalty – has risen sharply among an increasing number of wealthy people in Vietnam, one of Asia's fastest-growing economies.

A few years ago, farmers said the going rate for some fully grown Dong Tao roosters were as high as $2,000 each. But as the economy falters and the supply of the birds increased, a Dong Tao chicken now costs up to $450 -- that's an amount equivalent to a person’s entire month's income in Vietnam, according to a government income report in 2023.

""Whatever part of the chicken, when you eat it, it is delicious and has a satisfying bite. The meat is juicy and sweet with its own aroma,"" said Nhung's father, Nguyen Nhu Ngoc.

Some 800,000 of the chickens are currently being farmed in Dong Tao and its surrounding villages in Khoai Chau district in the northern Hung Yen province, up from around 500,000 in 2016, according to officials.

With sales expected to peak during Tet, Nhung, who sells the chickens largely online and does most of her marketing through TikTok videos, is in especially high spirits this time of the year.

""We farmers only look forward to this one holiday (when people go shopping) to sell (Dong Tao) chickens that we have worked so hard to raise all these years,” said Nhung.

“Our customers can have a luxurious and practical gift, which is a specialty from my village,"" she said.

Why ‘Dune: Part Two’ director decided to tell sequel story his own way
VIDEO SHOWS: TRAILER FOR 'DUNE PART TWO'; INTERVIEW WITH DIRECTOR DENIS VILLENEUVE AND ACTORS ZENDAYA AND TIMOTHEE CHALAMET

SHOWS: UNIDENTIFIED FILMING LOCATIONS (FILE) (Warner Bros - Must Courtesy with No Archive, No Resales)

1. EXCERPT TRAILER 'DUNE PART TWO'

LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, UNITED STATES (FEBRUARY 2, 2024) (Reuters - Access All)

2. (SOUNDBITE) (English) DIRECTOR, DENIS VILLENEUVE, SAYING:

""When Frank Herbert wrote the book and when the book was out, he was disappointed how people perceived Paul's character. He felt that people thought that Paul was a hero and for him, Paul was an anti-hero, he was a dark figure, he was a danger.

""Footprints becomes a nightmare because of course, you can erase some of them with computers but more, we had to protect and make sure because also it could also become a nightmare for VFX.

13. EXCERPT TRAILER 'DUNE PART TWO'

STORY: Canadian director Denis Villeneuve is inviting audiences back to Arrakis for the second part of 'Dune', his sci-fi epic starring Timothee Chalamet and Zendaya.

The first part of Villeneuve's Frank Herbert adaptation, which released in 2021, saw Chalamet's Paul go from noble heir to the House Atreides to being stranded with his mother Jessica on the desert planet Arrakis, where he begins to be seen as the messiah of the local people, the Fremen.

The second part picks up immediately after the first film, rather than follow author Frank Herbert's two year time jump, meaning certain narrative elements of the original book change.

Denis Villeneuve explained to Reuters ""When Frank Herbert wrote the book and when the book was out, he was disappointed how people perceived Paul's character. He felt that people thought that Paul was a hero and for him, Paul was an anti-hero, he was a dark figure, he was a danger, he wanted 'Dune' to be a warning against charismatic figures and for that he wrote 'Dune Messiah' like an epilogue that would correct the view on the first books.""

""Me, I know that. I had the benefit to know that. So when I wrote the adaptation I made sure to try to make sure that I was closer to Frank Herbert's initial intentions,"" he added.

Although in the films and books, the common enemy is the Emperor and the House Harkonnen, on set the villain was the sand, causing unique issues to both the cast and crew.

The 2021 release of 'Dune' was hampered by the global pandemic, which saw the film be streamed on HBO Max only a month after its theatrical release. This meant that much of the film's audience never saw the sound design or detailed production of the original, most notably shown in the giant worms that rear up from Arrakis' sand dunes.

""You will never have that experience at home. It's impossible,"" said Villeneuve, adding ""We put everything out there to make it a complete cinematic experience so I hope that people will go and see it in theaters. That's the only way you can really see the movie, in my opinion.""

Although the first part ended abruptly without a Hollywood ending, the second part ends with a cliffhanger, seemingly showing that the 'Dune' story will continue past the original novel.

""My goal in the beginning was to adapt 'Dune', the first book. I finished it. It would make sense to me to finish Paul Atreides' arc with 'Dune Messiah', the second book, and make a trilogy,"" said Villeneuve.

""So that's in the work right now and when I have a solid screenplay, there's a strong chances that I go back to Arakkis,"" he added.

'Dune Part Two' is released on March 1 in the United States.

14. VARIOUS OF PEOPLE QUEUEING TO BUY TRAIN TICKETS

STORY: Beijing Railway Station saw a surge in travellers on Thursday (February 8), as hundreds of millions in China head back to their hometowns to reunite with loved ones and celebrate the Lunar New Year, which falls on February 10 this year.

For passengers like 27-year-old programmer Yu Qi, whose hometown is in Henan province, the journey home will span over 20 hours, despite China's possession of the world's largest high-speed rail network.

State media has anticipated a record 9 billion domestic trips to be made during a 40-day travel rush around the Lunar New Year holidays, out of which about 80% will be self-driving road trips.

A total of 480 million train trips, the main mode of transportation in China, will be made nationwide during the 40-day period, a 38% jump from 2023 and up 17% from 2019 before the pandemic.

For passengers like 27-year-old programmer Yu Qi, whose hometown is in Henan province, the journey home will span over 20 hours, despite China's possession of the world's largest high-speed rail network.

State media has anticipated a record 9 billion domestic trips to be made during a 40-day travel rush around the Lunar New Year holidays, out of which about 80% will be self-driving road trips.

A total of 480 million train trips, the main mode of transportation in China, will be made nationwide during the 40-day period, a 38% jump from 2023 and up 17% from 2019 before the pandemic."

12. VARIOUS OF WILLIAM SEATED AMONG GUESTS

STORY: Prince William thanked the British public for their kind messages about his wife Kate following her recent surgery and about his father King Charles after he was diagnosed with cancer as he returned to official duties on Wednesday (February 7).

William took centre stage for the royals at a gala dinner for London's Air Ambulance Charity where guests included Hollywood actor Tom Cruise.

The event was the heir to the throne's second official public appearance on Wednesday on his return to work having postponed all engagements to look after his three children after Kate, 42, underwent planned abdominal surgery on Jan. 16, and then spent two weeks in hospital recovering.

Since then, his father has undergone treatment at the same hospital for an enlarged prostate, before Buckingham Palace announced on Monday (February 5) that subsequent tests on the 75-year-old monarch had revealed he had a form of cancer.

With the king postponing public duties to undergo out-patient treatment and Kate not expected to return to engagements until after Easter, the onus is on the remaining royals especially William and Charles' wife Queen Camilla, to provide the public face of the monarchy.

Charles will begin his recuperation at his Sandringham home in eastern England after being diagnosed with a form of cancer.

Buckingham Palace announced on Monday (February 5) that Charles, 75, on the throne for less than 18 months since the death of his mother Queen Elizabeth, had been diagnosed with the disease and would postpone his public engagements to undergo treatment.

The palace has said the king was remaining ""wholly positive,"" and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earlier on Tuesday said the cancer had been caught early.

2. (SOUNDBITE) (English) CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF 'MAGGIE'S' CANCER CHARITY, DAME LAURA LEE, SAYING:

""The King has chosen to be open about his cancer diagnosis, and that is a wonderful gift that he has given, his family, because it means that he's creating an open environment within which people can talk to him about how they're feeling, what their fears and their worries, and helping them come to terms with and understand the treatment path and days ahead.""

""It isn't something to be fearful of. Obviously it's a shock. Life gets turned upside down for a period of time, while one adjusts to the news, works out what the treatment path ahead, might lie. And has to adjust what might or might not be possible in terms of normal daily living. But alongside that comes, hope and taking back control by understanding what's ahead.""

""What's so important about the openness of the diagnosis, about also King Charles sharing, going in for an investigation, for one problem and then discovering cancer. I think hopefully encourages people to go and talk to their doctor to seek advice. And even if it ends up being nothing to be reassured and if it ends up being something, and hopefully that means that cancer can be found earlier and also then be more easily to treat.""

10. CAMILLA AND MAGGIE'S CEO DAME LAURA LEE LEAVING BUILDING

STORY: The CEO of cancer charity Maggie’s, Dame Laura Lee, said on Tuesday (February 6) that King Charles' openness about his cancer diagnosis is 'a gift' to his family and others.

The charity, of which Queen Camilla is president, hopes that by King Charles revealing his cancer diagnosis to the public, it will encourage other to go their doctor and seek advice.

Lee added that despite Charles’ diagnosis there comes “hope and taking back control by understanding what's ahead.""

King Charles smiled and waved to passers-by on Tuesday as he was seen in public for the first time since it was revealed he was suffering from a form of cancer.

Prince William is expected to step up to fulfill some of the monarch's duties, along with other senior royals while Charles begins a series of out-patient treatments.

The palace has said the king was remaining ""wholly positive,"" and Prime Minister Rishi Sunak earlier on Tuesday said the cancer had been caught early.

3. DRONE FOOTAGE SHOWING TWO CHINESE COAST GUARD VESSEL BLOCKING PHILIPPINE COAST GUARD VESSEL

STORY: The Philippines' coast guard (PCG) on Sunday (February 11) accused China of ""dangerous and blocking"" maneuvers while its vessel patrolled near Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea this month.

Drone footage released by the Philippine Coast Guard on Sunday showed various China Coast Guard vessels blocking the 97-metre (318-foot) Philippine vessel BRP Teresa Magbanua during a patrol on Thursday (February 8). Four Chinese maritime militia vessels were also present near the shoal, the PCG said.

The Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accusations. The embassy was shut for the weekend.

The PCG said its vessel was in the area to protect Filipino fishermen ""from further harassment"" in their traditional fishing ground. It said that the Chinese vessels performed dangerous and blocking maneuvers four times, crossing the bow of the PCG vessels twice.

China claims almost the entire South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion in annual ship commerce. Its territorial claims overlap with the exclusive economic zones of the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei.

STORY: Deputies from the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office were called to a Tampa apartment complex on Thursday (February 8) morning a resident reported a kangaroo on the loose.

The sheriff's office posted on social media about the unusual situation, sharing a video where a perplexed 911 caller reported the kangaroo's presence in the apartment complex's pool area.

Assisted by the Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office Agriculture Unit, deputies managed to reunite the kangaroo with its owner, who had proper registrations for the animal. However, the circumstances of how the kangaroo got loose were not disclosed by authorities.

Aerial footage from a police helicopter of the scene captured the kangaroo hopping around the pool, a sight not commonly seen even in Florida. While kangaroos are native to Australia, certain wildlife can be owned as pets in Florida with the appropriate permits.

STORY: The Directors Guild of America (DGA) held a glitzy awards ceremony in Beverly Hills on Saturday (February 10) to recognize the top directorial achievements of 2023, ahead of the movie world's top honors, the Oscars, in March.

The nominees for the top award of outstanding directorial achievement in theatrical feature film are Greta Gerwig for 'Barbie', Yorgos Lanthimos for 'Poor Things', Christopher Nolan for 'Oppenheimer', Alexander Payne for 'The Holdovers' and Martin Scorsese for 'Killers of the Flower Moon'.

Korean-Canadian director Celine Song was nominated in the category of first-time theatrical feature film for her modern romance 'Past Lives.' She said being recognized by her peers was special.

""It is such an honor to just be here among so many amazing directors that I've admired forever,"" she said.

The DGA is the leading industry group representing film and television directors. Past DGA feature film award winners have often gone on to claim the best director Oscar and see their films win best picture from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

The Oscars will be handed out in Hollywood on March 10 to producers, directors, actors and actresses in a star-studded television show viewed around the world and among the most-watched TV programs in the United States.

And the Mariupol will never be just awards. But it's also a symbol for more than just one city. It's a symbol for all other Ukrainian cities that have been destroyed.

STORY: The Directors Guild of America (DGA) held a glitzy awards ceremony in Beverly Hills on Saturday (February 10) to recognize the top directorial achievements of 2023, ahead of the movie world's top honors, the Oscars, in March.

The nominees for the top award of outstanding directorial achievement in theatrical feature film are Greta Gerwig for 'Barbie', Yorgos Lanthimos for 'Poor Things', Christopher Nolan for 'Oppenheimer', Alexander Payne for 'The Holdovers' and Martin Scorsese for 'Killers of the Flower Moon'.

Korean-Canadian director Celine Song was nominated in the category of first-time theatrical feature film for her modern romance 'Past Lives.' She said being recognized by her peers was special.

""It is such an honor to just be here among so many amazing directors that I've admired forever,"" she said.

The DGA is the leading industry group representing film and television directors. Past DGA feature film award winners have often gone on to claim the best director Oscar and see their films win best picture from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

The Oscars will be handed out in Hollywood on March 10 to producers, directors, actors and actresses in a star-studded television show viewed around the world and among the most-watched TV programs in the United States.","['ARTS', 'CULTURE', 'ENTERTAINMENTFILMNORTH AMERICA']",9541,3,,Broadcast: None.

STORY: A father and daughter duo arrived in Las Vegas on Saturday (February 10) just in time for the Super Bowl, after winning a prize giveaway of a lifetime. Thanks to Vivid Seats, the pair was selected among hundreds of entries as the ultimate Taylor and Football duo in America.

""My dad sends it to me as sort of just, what do you call it? I mean, he sort of sent it to me on off-beat, but I didn't tell him I entered,"" Natalie Dionisio (Dee-O-Nee-See-O) told Reuters.

To Natalie's surprise, Vivid Seats followed her on Instagram and she received a message alerting her she had won the contest.

Natalie says her love for Taylor Swift began when her late mother introduced her to the singer at a young age and while she cannot share this moment with her, she is grateful she still has her father.

""Being able to share that, after she passed away, being able to share that with my dad as well and it not being, I guess, sort of taken away from me,"" she said.

According to the contest, there has been a spike in father-daughter bonding in recent months inspired by the relationship between Swift and Kansas City Chiefs Tight-End Travis Kelsey.

The grand prize package is estimated at $25,000, according to Vivid Seats.

8. PROTESTERS MARCHING

STORY: An estimated 300 protesters marched in Milan on Saturday (February 10) to demonstrate against the environmental impact the Winter Olympics that will be held in northern Italy in 2026 will have.

The protest was organised by a group calling itself the ""Unsustainable Olympics Committee"" and demonstrators in the crowd held painted signs reading ""Fake Snow. Real Profit"".

The Games will be held in two main locations - Milan itself and the Alpine ski resort of Cortina D'Ampezzo, and the protesters said that a large part of the country would suffer damage because of the construction work needed.

Italy's Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti said last week that he was increasingly worried about delays in preparations for the Olympics that will run from Feb. 6-22 in 2026.

The Italian authorities have just signed a deal with a construction firm to build a sliding track in Cortina, aiming to resolve a long-running area of delay and uncertainty.

SHOWS: Israeli airstrikes killed in total 17 people in Gaza's Rafah overnight, medics said on Saturday (February 10), as over a million Palestinians cramming into the border city await a full-blown offensive with the rest of their enclave in ruins and nowhere left to run.

Palestinians in Rafah mourned on Saturday the loss of 12 member from two families who were among those killed in Israeli overnight airstrikes while they were inside their home in the Jeninah neighbourhood in Eastern Rafah, relatives said.

Four months into the war in Gaza, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said it has ordered the military to develop a plan to evacuate the population of Rafah and destroy four Hamas battalions it says are deployed there. (9451-ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS/GAZA-FUNERAL)

Relatives found the body on Saturday of a 6-year-old Palestinian girl who had begged Gaza rescuers to send help after being trapped by Israeli military fire, along with the bodies of five of her family members and two ambulance workers who had gone to save her. The Palestine Red Crescent Society accused Israel of deliberately targeting the ambulance it sent to rescue Hind Rajab after she had spent hours on the phone to dispatchers begging for help with the sound of shooting echoing around.

""We have a great opportunity here tomorrow to keep the cup at home because we know it's very difficult when you organize an AFCON (Africa Cup of Nations) to win the competition. So tomorrow we will be 90 minutes away from achieving this feat and, at the same time, adding a third victory to the Ivory Coast's orange jersey. So we will prepare again today to accomplish this feat.""

""Psychologically, I think both teams will be at the same level, but as with any high-level match, any final, it will come down to a small detail that is hard to determine today. We will try to make a good start to the match, we will try to tire them out tactically and physically, but we will not rush. We will be patient because a final is 90 minutes. We know there is pressure on both sides, so we will focus on starting the match well and we will be patient.""

""The most important thing for us after the group stages was to regain confidence and recreate a team. We were a team that didn't seem to be united, to be together on the field, it was important for us, the staff, to recreate this defensive solidity before thinking about offensive solidity. As for the question of whether we imagined reaching the final, I won't say we imagined reaching the final, but we dreamed, we hoped to go to the final, and we took the matches one after the other because we knew where we came from and didn't want to project ourselves. So we focused each time on the upcoming match, trying to put all the chances on our side to win that match and move to the next step.""

""This is how football works, you know. Strikers are put forwards, you know, put in front of everyone, so yeah, that's the life. But this is a good pressure as well. You play the Africa Cup in your own country, you have a lot of people who are just pushing you, who support you every day. So it gives you the strength to just perform. So that's a beautiful thing, and I hope that this good pressure will bring my country to the top.""

So now, at the moment, when you see the last month, everything that happened, yeah, it's kind of a great moment today to be here in front of you today to speak about the final for Africa Cup, in your own country.

STORY: Ivory Coast can complete a remarkable recovery and put a successful seal on an absorbing Africa Cup of Nations tournament if they can beat Nigeria on Sunday (February 11) and claim the title on home soil.

The Ivorians are one game away from the continent’s top prize despite being on the verge of elimination on several occasions over the last month. They scraped through the group phase, staged thrilling come-from-behind wins in the last-16 and quarter-final and are now looking to complete one of the great comebacks in the tournament’s storied history.

The Ivorians lost to Nigeria in their second group game when a cagey contest was decided by a penalty, only awarded after a lengthy VAR review. Nigeria employed a clever tactical plan, which included an uncharacteristic five-man defence and extensive use of the flanks to attack.

Their X-factor, however, remains striker Victor Osimhen, who has had an outstanding tournament despite scoring only once. The reigning African Footballer of the Year has an eye-catching work rate and is a constant menace for opposing defenders although he struggled with a stomach complaint in their semi-final success over South Africa.

STORY: Cuba has charged 30 people for stealing 133 tonnes of chicken and selling them on the street in a rare major heist at a time of food shortages in the communist-run nation.

Thieves took the meat, in 1,660 white boxes, from a state facility in the capital Havana, and used the sale proceeds to buy refrigerators, laptops, televisions and air conditioners, according to a Cuban state TV broadcast late on Friday (February 9).

Authorities did not say when the chicken theft took place, but noted it likely occurred between midnight and 2 a.m., when they detected fluctuations in the temperature of the cold storage facility. Video surveillance captured trucks transporting the chicken off site.

The 30 charged included shift bosses and IT workers at the plant, as well as security guards and outsiders not directly affiliated with the company, the TV report said.

The suspects, if found guilty, could face as many as 20 years in prison.

STORY: Cuba has charged 30 people for stealing 133 tonnes of chicken and selling them on the street in a rare major heist at a time of food shortages in the communist-run nation.

Thieves took the meat, in 1,660 white boxes, from a state facility in the capital Havana, and used the sale proceeds to buy refrigerators, laptops, televisions and air conditioners, according to a Cuban state TV broadcast late on Friday (February 9).

Authorities did not say when the chicken theft took place, but noted it likely occurred between midnight and 2 a.m., when they detected fluctuations in the temperature of the cold storage facility. Video surveillance captured trucks transporting the chicken off site.

The 30 charged included shift bosses and IT workers at the plant, as well as security guards and outsiders not directly affiliated with the company, the TV report said.

The suspects, if found guilty, could face as many as 20 years in prison.","['CRIMECRIME', 'LAW', 'JUSTICESOUTH AMERICA', 'CENTRAL AMERICA']",9507,6,,Broadcast: None. Digital: None..

2. BLACK KIA IN WHICH 6-YEAR-OLD HIND RAJAB HAD BEEN TRAVELLING, SMASHED AND RIDDLED WITH BULLET HOLES

STORY: Relatives on Saturday (February 10) found the body of a 6-year-old Palestinian girl who had begged Gaza rescuers to send help after being trapped by Israeli military fire, along with the bodies of five of her family members and two ambulance workers who had gone to save her.

Footage released by the Palestine Red Crescent Society (PRCS) showed the remnants of one of their vehicles in which emergency workers were travelling, as well as the black car in which 6-year-old Hind Rajab's body was found. Reuters was not able to independently verify the location of the video.

The PRCS accused Israel of deliberately targeting the ambulance it sent to rescue Hind after she had spent hours on the phone to dispatchers begging for help with the sound of shooting echoing around.

The audio clips released by the Red Crescent earlier this month recorded a call to dispatchers that was first made by Hind's teenage cousin Layan Hamadeh, saying an Israeli tank was approaching before shots rang out and she screamed.

Believed to be the only survivor, Hind stayed on the line for three hours with dispatchers, who tried to soothe her as they prepared to send an ambulance.

The PCRS said that after coordinating with the Israeli military through mediators and receiving a green light, it determined it was safe enough to send an ambulance with two crew, Youssef Zeino and Ahmed Al-Madhoon.

Contact was then lost with both the ambulance team and Hind, leaving their families, colleagues and many around the world concerned about their fate.

STORY: Tens of thousands of supporters of Indonesia's presidential contenders packed final rallies in the capital Jakarta and the Central Java cities of Solo and Semarang on Saturday (10 February), as campaigning draws to a close ahead of the world's biggest single-day election.

Candidates will enter a cooling off period from Sunday (11 Feb) to election day on Wednesday (14 Feb), where three contestants are running to succeed the hugely popular President Joko Widodo, who has led Indonesia for a decade and cannot run again.

The contenders to lead the world's third-largest democracy are popular former governors Ganjar Pranowo and Anies Baswedan, and ex-special forces commander Prabowo Subianto, who has soared in opinion polls with the tacit backing of the president, and with the incumbent's son as his running mate.

At stake is the leadership for the next five years of a mineral-rich Group of 20 economy of 270 million people positioning itself as a future destination for multinational firms in the electric vehicle supply chain.

The biggest party's Ganjar will be seeking to shore up his support in Central Java, which he served for two decades as a governor and lawmaker, while Anies, an independent candidate who was governor of the capital from 2017-2022, will hold his rally at the city's biggest stadium.

Defence Minister Prabowo is contesting his third successive election and holds his rally at another stadium in Jakarta, hoping to convert his big social media following among young Indonesians into votes. More than half of Indonesia's 204.8 million electorate is under 40.

Candidates will enter a cooling off period from Sunday (11 Feb) to election day on Wednesday (14 Feb), where three contestants are running to succeed the hugely popular President Joko Widodo, who has led Indonesia for a decade and cannot run again.

The contenders to lead the world's third-largest democracy are popular former governors Ganjar Pranowo and Anies Baswedan, and ex-special forces commander Prabowo Subianto, who has soared in opinion polls with the tacit backing of the president, and with the incumbent's son as his running mate.

At stake is the leadership for the next five years of a mineral-rich Group of 20 economy of 270 million people positioning itself as a future destination for multinational firms in the electric vehicle supply chain.

The biggest party's Ganjar will be seeking to shore up his support in Central Java, which he served for two decades as a governor and lawmaker, while Anies, an independent candidate who was governor of the capital from 2017-2022, will hold his rally at the city's biggest stadium.

Defence Minister Prabowo is contesting his third successive election and holds his rally at another stadium in Jakarta, hoping to convert his big social media following among young Indonesians into votes. More than half of Indonesia's 204.8 million electorate is under 40."

STORY: Smoke was seen rising over Israel's northern border with Lebanon on Saturday (February 10).

An Israeli strike about 60 km inside Lebanon's southern border earlier in the day targeted a Palestinian figure close to Hamas but he survived, four security sources said.

Three other people were killed, including one member of the powerful, Iran-backed Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, a Hamas ally, the security sources also told Reuters.

STORY: Ukraine's Kyiv Zoo on Friday (February 9) received food donations from Germany to help keep their animals alive through the winter and feed newborn baby animals in the spring.

German and Austrian zoos including the two Berlin zoos as well as Austrian zoos Tierpark Schoenbrunn and Alpenzoo Innsbruck donated a total of 25 tonnes of dry animal feed, and video footage showed a truckload of feed leaving Tierpark Berlin earlier in the week and arriving in the snow at Kyiv Zoo in the Ukrainian capital.

Kyiv Zoo director Kyrylo Trantin said many of the animals are traumatised, having been brought from war-torn regions, and the zookeepers try to rehabilitate them amid the sounds of explosions and sirens.

STORY: Argentina's friendly against Ivory Coast, scheduled to be held in Beijing in March, has been cancelled, the Chinese city's football association said on Saturday (February 10), following a backlash against Lionel Messi's failure to play in a match in Hong Kong.

Beijing's announcement came a day after Hangzhou's sports authorities also cancelled a friendly between Argentina and Nigeria after Messi's failure to play for Inter Miami in Hong Kong on Sunday caused widespread anger among fans.

Messi, who did not play in the friendly in Hong Kong due to a reported injury, appeared as a second-half substitute on Wednesday in Inter Miami's friendly against Vissel Kobe in Tokyo.

Organisers of the Hong Kong friendly, Tatler Asia, announced a 50% refund on tickets, which cost up to nearly HK$ 5000 ($639), following criticism from the Hong Kong government.

The Ukrainian air force said that air defense and mobile groups of drone hunters shot down 23 out of 31 Russian-launched drones, which were targeting the Kharkiv region in the northeast of the country and also the Odesa region in the south.
